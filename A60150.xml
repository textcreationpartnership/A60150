            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE viſible Decay of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and Evangelical Holineſs, is a common ſubject of Complaint: and hardly ever more juſtly than <hi>now,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Generality of Churches, and particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. All ſerious and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Perſons muſt needs reckon themſelves obliged on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both to <hi>Mourn</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi> The cauſes of ſerious Mourning are too many, and too notorious, to be unobſerved by thoſe, who
<pb facs="tcp:106982:3"/> have any Knowledge of the preſent State of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt <hi>Reformed.</hi> The general <hi>unacquaintedneſs</hi> with the Myſteries of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> the Reproach of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies by the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> of its Doctrines and Worſhip, and the diſhonour caſt upon its moſt ſacred Institutions; the late terrible Deſolations of the Temple and Sanctuary, and grievous ſufferings of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in many parts of the World; the ſhameful <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of ſo many Thouſands from the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Goſpel, and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kind, which might
<pb facs="tcp:106982:3"/> be named, do carry with them a loud call to Humiliation and Mourning.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Practical</hi> Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Profeſſing Chriſtians unto <hi>Worldlineſs, Profaneſs,</hi> and <hi>Senſuality,</hi> doth not only afford matter of <hi>Lamentation</hi> for the preſent, but too much ground to <hi>Fear,</hi> that <hi>the bitterneſs of Death is not paſt;</hi> that God<hi>'s</hi> Anger is not turned away, or his Controverſie ended with the Proteſtant Churches. And after we have known ſo many <hi>Thouſands</hi> to renounce and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their Religion in an Hour of Temptation, and ſee ſo many more (yea the far greateſt part,) in a preparedneſs to Revolt, on
<pb facs="tcp:106982:4"/> the like or leſſer Trials, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their <hi>vicious Lives,</hi> (becauſe they receive not the Truth in the Love of it,) what can we reaſonably expect, but further Tokens of Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure?</p>
            <p>And how <hi>little</hi> of any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Proſpect is there, by the ſerious <hi>Reformation</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Families, and Churches to turn away his Wrath? Where are there any <hi>Symptoms</hi> of the <hi>Recovery</hi> of the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> from whence in our Age there is ſo undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Declenſion? (and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all Parties that there is ſo.) How little is to be ſeen of any ſuch thing, among thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:106982:4"/> who are moſt <hi>Forward</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> in eſpouſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt? even ſuch as would be thought of all others to be moſt concerned for its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and have ſuffered not a little for it?</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed caſe of our Brethren cannot but move our Bowels of Compaſſion, when we read or hear from time to time the Relation of the barbarous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of their Perſecutors. But the <hi>ſenſual wicked Lives of profeſſedly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chriſtians,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a more <hi>dreadful</hi> object to be conſidered, and ought ſo to be regarded by us, as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of it are much more
<pb facs="tcp:106982:5"/> to be <hi>feared,</hi> than of the fiercest <hi>Perſecution</hi> by open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Enemies. For the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> never lost either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Holineſs</hi> that way; it hath rather been a conſiderable <hi>outward Means,</hi> for the preſervation and encreaſe of <hi>Both.</hi> Though this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, but the direct <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> concerning <hi>Proteſtants</hi> perſecuting one another for <hi>leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Differences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſad Effects of it have been ſeen and felt to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in weakning the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon truly Chriſtian Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> among us, that now, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there is a louder Call than ordinary to <hi>Forbearance,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:106982:5"/> 
               <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> and <hi>Unity of Affection;</hi> that our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with a <hi>revengeful, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Spirit,</hi> may not prove our Ruin.</p>
            <p>And whatever Expectations we may and ought to have, from the unfulfilled <hi>Prophecies,</hi> of God's <hi>rebuilding Sion,</hi> in the latter days, and deſtroying her Enemies; (which we have no reaſon to queſtion but he will moſt gloriouſly effect, and ought daily to pray that he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it, for his Names ſake:) yet can we never hope to ſee any thing conſiderable of that kind, in our Time, without a great <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>more Plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:106982:6"/> pouring out of the H. Spirit for the healing of the Nations.</hi> I therefore wiſh that the confident expectations of a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> deliverance of the Church, may not divert us from the <hi>preſent Duty</hi> we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, as the proper appointed <hi>Means,</hi> to which God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us for that end.</p>
            <p>Before the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> what was it that did hinder the <hi>Jews</hi> from hearkning to the Voice of God and Man for their Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but this Preſumption, that at that time their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would come and ſave 'em? And that <hi>Day of the Lord</hi> which is expected, (wherein he will
<pb facs="tcp:106982:6"/> plead the Controverſie of <hi>Zion</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi>) how Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoever it may be in the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> may be, 'tis likely it will be ſuch, as ſhall diſappoint our vain and fooliſh <hi>Hopes</hi> concerning it. God will <hi>throughly</hi> purge his Temple, and puniſh the Men that <hi>are at Eaſe,</hi> and <hi>ſetled on their Lees,</hi> and tread down the <hi>Outer-court</hi> of falſe Profeſſors. Therefore all ranks and degrees of Men ſhould be awakened to ſerious Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>And are there any <hi>hopeful Beginnings</hi> of ſuch a Thing, within view? Is there any thing on Foot to be obſerved, like ſuch a retrieving of <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb facs="tcp:106982:7"/> Holineſs</hi> in the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of Men? Doth not the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> grow more and more into Contempt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day? and who can tell how far it may proceed, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Judgment</hi> upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Place or <hi>Country,</hi> that is guilty of ſo general, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking a Defection?</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore, <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one</hi> to look to himſelf; to <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>do our firſt Works,</hi> and make our Peace with God, that we may be found within the <hi>ſmall number</hi> of thoſe, who ſhall be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eſcape the almoſt <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> infection, and <hi>to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> On
<pb facs="tcp:106982:7"/> which Account, any thing that is likely to awaken Men to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> cannot be unſeaſonable. Yea, in ſuch a caſe the <hi>meaneſt,</hi> and weakeſt Endeavours may be of <hi>ſome</hi> uſe. The <hi>Subjects</hi> of the following <hi>Reflections</hi> are moſt of them of that kind, neceſſary to be attended to by all ſorts of Perſons; and ſo cannot be too often preſt, though in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Manners.</p>
            <p>The uſefulneſs of the ſubject <hi>Matter,</hi> and the ſmalneſs of the <hi>Bulk,</hi> are two things which are wont to recommend a Book to moſt Readers. For which reaſon, I may Hope, this will
<pb facs="tcp:106982:8"/> be read by ſeveral, who ſuffer much better, (becauſe bigger,) books to lye by them neglected. Some may poſſibly give it the reading, as a <hi>New-years gift.</hi> And whoever ſhall be ſo far perſwaded by it as to ſet apart ſome Time in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Year, for <hi>Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Confeſſion of ſin, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Thankſgiving,</hi> and ſolemn renewal <hi>of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God,</hi> (which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe Reflections may not only <hi>excite</hi> to, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to direct and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him in,) I am perſwaded he will thank me for putting him in mind (at leaſt,) of ſo <hi>ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> an Exerciſe. The greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:106982:8"/> part of theſe Meditations were begun on a <hi>New-years day,</hi> tho ſome <hi>others</hi> are thought fit to be inſerted, as tending to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſame deſign. But knowing how much <hi>eaſier</hi> it is to ſtir up <hi>other Mens</hi> Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to command and keep alive <hi>my own;</hi> 'tis deſired that the moſt devout Thoughts contained in theſe Papers, may be looked upon as what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aims at, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to, rather than what he hath already attained: as what he knows he <hi>ought to be and do,</hi> and doth ſeriouſly endeavour rather than what <hi>he is,</hi> and <hi>hath been:</hi> heartily lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein he hath been Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:106982:9"/> or defective in ſuch <hi>duties,</hi> as theſe, and the like Reflections, do oblige to, and enforce upon <hi>All,</hi> who ſhall read them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>That they were Penn'd at <hi>ſeveral times,</hi> and in occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Retirements for Spiritual Exerciſes, will, with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Subjects, be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent excuſe, that ſome are <hi>larger</hi> and others <hi>ſhorter,</hi> and that the <hi>Style</hi> is in ſome places more <hi>neglected</hi> than in others. If I may hereby render <hi>any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to the Souls of Men, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecure Sinner, any Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Hypocrite, or backſliding Chriſtian be hereby awakened, or any ſerious Believer's <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106982:9"/> be quickned and advanced, I hope God will accept it. To his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> I humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; for thoſe Ends.</p>

A Period ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and extraordinary, as that was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> deſerved very well to be particularly remembred and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: and might juſtly be accounted the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or chiefeſt <hi>of their months.</hi> And by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. it may be concluded that <hi>Abraham</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> on the fifteenth day of this month: and 'tis computed that about the ſame time of the year <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born; and the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> afterwards erected in the wilderneſs.</p>

The extraordinary Blowing of Trumpets by the Prieſts at this time, (in all their Cities, as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where two Silver<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the famous Jewiſh Rabbin, thinks the ſounding of Trumpets at this time was deſigned to ſignifie ſome ſuch Exhortation as this<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Canones de Poenitent. cap. <hi>3.</hi> can. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>Ariſe, O ye ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106982:16"/> out of your ſleep, and you that ſlumber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of your ſlumbering. Search your works, and turn by Repentance. Remember your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, you that have forgotten the Truth, and have exchanged it for the Vanities of the World; and have all your Lives wandred after Vanity, which will not profit or deliver you. Conſider your Souls, conſider your Ways, and Works, and let every one of you forſake his evil way, and his thoughts that are not good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have imagined a typical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the <hi>two Covenants</hi> in this Feaſt. The Old Covenant figured by the Year paſſed; and the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpel ſtate by the New Year then begun; and that by the ſound of Trumpets was prefigured the future Preaching of the Goſpel, according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Their ſound went forth unto all the Earth, and their words unto the end of the World;</hi> and ſo the Feaſt of Trumpets is abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Preaching of the Goſpel, if that were typically ſignified by it. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel is <hi>the joyful ſound,</hi> Pſalm 89.15. And Miniſters are to lift up their Voice like a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> Iſaiah 58.1. the diſcharge of their Office as Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is expreſt by <hi>ſetting the Trumpet to their mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 8.1. Ezek. 33. When the Jews ſhall be converted to the Faith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106982:17"/> of Chriſt, it is ſaid, <hi>in that day the great Trumpet ſhall be blown, and they ſhall come, who were ready to periſh,</hi> Iſaiah 27. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Twas the Office of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to ſound theſe Trumpets, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſet apart for that Work, as the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> for theirs. We read but of <hi>two</hi> Trumpets at firſt, for <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Iſhamar,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 3.4. But <hi>David</hi> added many muſical Inſtruments: And in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, at the dedication of the Temple, we read of one hundred and twenty Prieſts who ſounded with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.12. Without ſuppoſing any Type here, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe; we may yet farther conſider the Parallel, and obſerve, how the Joy and Gratitude of theſe Trumpets did excite, is exceeded by that greater rejoycing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and foretold by the Prophets, when the glad tidings of the Goſpel of Salvation by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be publiſht to the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27. which hath been in <hi>part</hi> accompliſht: And will be more compleat, in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> which Chriſt will eſtabliſh upon Earth, toward the end of the World: And ſhall be finally
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106982:17"/> perfected at the end of Time; when Days and Years, and Time (thus meaſured) ſhall be no more. When the Meſſiah our <hi>B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> having finiſhed his mediatory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, as to what concerns <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhall come again from <hi>Heaven,</hi> with <hi>the Trump of God,</hi> to raiſe the <hi>Dead,</hi> and ſummon all the World to their final Judgment. Then <hi>ſhall he deliver up the Kingdom to his Father:</hi> And the Faithful enter into <hi>the Joy of their Lord,</hi> and be <hi>for ever</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>There is a Tradition among the Jews mentioned by <hi>Maimonides</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Canones de Poenit. ch. <hi>3.</hi> can. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note>, that on the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the <hi>New Year,</hi> God enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Judgment</hi> for the Sins of the <hi>Year and Life paſt.</hi> That every ones Faults are weighed againſt his good Works.

            <p>And 'tis a general Cuſtom that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the ten firſt days of the <hi>New Year,</hi> to riſe out of their Beds in the Night, and to continue in their <hi>Synagogues</hi> praying and worſhipping until break of day.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106982:24"/> we are equally ignorant concerning <hi>our ſelves</hi> till an hour of Temptation.

And as it is with <hi>Man</hi> himſelf, ſo with every thing that he Values himſelf upon, or for which he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106982:25"/> is eſteemed by others; and even his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> is alſo changeable and uncertain.

               <p>How vain and faulty is an Ambition to be talkt of afater we are dead, which will

For how little a while do the proudeſt Monuments laſt, that are ſet over the rotten Fleſh and Bones of many, to preſerve their Memory? God hath promis'd, 'tis true, that <hi>the Righteous ſhall be had in everlaſting Remembranc;</hi> but it muſt be underſtood ſo far only as the frame and ſtate of this World, and the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Viciſſitudes of Time will permit. But what Good can it do us, farther than the Intereſt of Gods Glory, and the Good of others is concerned in it? The Bleſſed will not need it, and the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have no advantage by it. And no Endeavours can be certain of Succeſs: For People will talk of us as they <hi>pleaſe;</hi> and their Opinions very often change from one Extream to the other.

               <p>I Now begin another Year: But what Aſſurance have I to out-live it? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay how ſoon my Sovereign Judge may call me hence, and ſummon me to appear before his Righteous Bar. O let me not defer my neceſſary Preparation for <hi>Death,</hi> which may be nearer than I imagine! Let me mind the Great things <hi>first,</hi> which are of abſolute neceſſity to be done, ſome time or other before I dye. This periſhing <hi>Body</hi> which I have pampered and indulged, at the expence of ſo much Coſt and Time, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying in a ſilent Grave, before half this Year be paſt. Lord! bleſs this thought, to awaken my diligent endeavours to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Bleſſedneſs of <hi>Eternity!</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Deſire of Great things for my ſelf, in future Years, by the conſidered poſſibility of dying before the end of this! Let me look into the Graves of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106982:27"/> others, and conſider that this may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen to me, and muſt ere long be my own caſe: Let me think what <hi>this Body</hi> will ſhortly be, when it hath been ſix or eight days ſeparated from my Soul; how vile? how loathſome? that I may deſpiſe the Beauty, and be dead to the Pleaſures of the Body, which ſo eaſily, ſo ſuddenly, ſo ſtrangely may be changed. For no <hi>Glaſs</hi> is more brittle, no <hi>Bubble</hi> more vaniſhing, no <hi>Ice</hi> more diſſolving, no <hi>Flower</hi> more fading, no <hi>Shadow</hi> leſs ſubſtantial, no <hi>Sleep</hi> or <hi>Dream</hi> more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, no <hi>Sound</hi> more tranſient, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vain and more uncertain than <hi>Life,</hi> on which all other things in this World depend. <hi>My days are as nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> though they laſted above two Ages. There is hardly any thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Frail</hi> and <hi>Fading,</hi> Mutable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but the Spirit of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſets forth the <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> by; as if he would teach us by it, from the Light of every periſhing Object, which our Eyes behold, to reflect on our own Mortality. We ſleep every <hi>Night,</hi> in the outer Chambers of Death: And in ſome Diſeaſes <hi>Sleep,</hi> which is the <hi>image</hi> and Picture of <hi>Death,</hi> is taken away, to give place to the <hi>Original,</hi> and make
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106982:28"/> way for death. And every year, every week, every day are haſtening to our final <hi>Change;</hi> which may overtake us ere we are aware. Every day we loſe ſome part of our Lives; in our very <hi>growth</hi> from Infancy to Manhood, our Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes and grows leſs. Every Pulſe and Breath doth tell us we are haſtening to the End of Time, and calls upon us to diſpatch our Work. Every <hi>Word</hi> we ſpeak, is formed of that Breath whereby we live; and we may not live to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce another Sentence, but the Lamp of Life may be extinguiſht and blown out by a ſudden Blaſt. Every thing we do, carries away ſome Sands of our little Glaſs of Time; and how little may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? Or how ſoon may the <hi>Glaſs</hi> be broke? Our Souls are in our Bodies, as a little <hi>Air</hi> incloſed in a thin <hi>Bubble;</hi> how eaſily is that broken, and where are we? How many who are now alive, in health and vigour, who deliberate on their Meat and Drink, and are curious of Air and Exerciſe, to maintain themſelves in Health, and pleaſe themſelves with the Dream of Years to come, ſhall never ſee another <hi>New-years-day?</hi> It may be not another month, or week or morrow? Many
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106982:28"/> have promiſed themſelves great things on the morrow, but dyed before Night: Let me not ſay, I ſhall not dye <hi>this Day,</hi> when I may <hi>this Hour;</hi> and 'tis but <hi>once</hi> for all, there is no amending an ill Death, by another Tryal. <q rend="inline">When I lye down to ſleep, I hope to riſe ſtronger and freſher, and fitter for work; but I know withal, I may riſe no more. And may not my Name be on the Roll of thoſe who ſhall <hi>next</hi> be called, at leaſt ſome time <hi>this Year?</hi> Let me not then neglect or fooliſhly delay my <hi>Principal Buſineſs,</hi> to provide againſt a <hi>Change,</hi> which is inevitable, but the time of it altogether doubtful. Ought not my firſt and chiefeſt Care be imployed to make my Peace with <hi>God,</hi> (He <hi>alone</hi> can be my Happineſs; to his final Judgment I am haſtening: His Favour <hi>alone</hi> can give me ſupport and Joy in a dying Hour: To his Mercy I muſt truſt, when I leave this World, and can have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage more by any thing in it:) that he may mercifully receive my Soul at Death and be my <hi>Everlaſting</hi> Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Do I know my Life is thus vain and tranſient, and ſhall I not ſeriouſly improve it to ſuch a Purpoſe? Shall theſe Thoughts leave no <hi>Impreſſion</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106982:29"/> me? Do I breath continually in this Element of <hi>Vanity,</hi> and yet forget where I am, and remain inſenſible of ſo near a Change? Shall theſe Thoughts paſs away as a vaniſhing Cloud, and diſtil no ſoftening drops on my Soul? Shall the Image of Death, which meets me every where, be only like an appearing Ghoſt or Phantaſm, that ſtartles and ſcares a little, but is preſently gone, and no more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? O! let me now remember to make <hi>God</hi> my Friend, and ſecure an intereſt in his Eternal Mercy, while the Day laſts; yea, while my Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are free, and not diſturbed and clouded by Fear and Pain, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Body, as commonly they are in <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> if God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me that Warning, which yet I may not promiſe my ſelf to have, for I may be cut off by a Sudden Stroke, before the end of <hi>this Year,</hi> I now begin.</q>

               <p>WHen I look back on the preceeding Years of my Life, how eaſily can I graſp them all at once? they are even <hi>as Yeſterday when 'tis paſt.</hi> But ſo many Years to come hath ſomething great and vaſt, which fills my Thoughts, and affects my Mind, after another manner. Such is the difference between <hi>paſt</hi> Injoyments, and the Expectation of <hi>future.</hi> Let me ſuppoſe the ſame term and duration of Years, and yet how different are my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of what is paſt, and of what is yet to come! Things paſt by a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſome remarkable Paſſages, when they happened, ſeem to be preſent with me: But not knowing what may happen in the ſame number of Years to come, I have nothing whereon to ſix my Thoughts. Or the Reaſon of this Difference may rather be, that Men in this degenerate &amp; neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous State (with unſatisfied Deſires reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Happineſs, and ſenſible nothing preſent can afford it, and knowing by Experience that nothing paſt could have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106982:30"/> done it, (are eagerly deſirous of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and becauſe we know not but what is to come may procure it, we hope it will; which makes the Time ſeem long by reaſon of our Expectation and Deſire of <hi>Good.</hi> Whereas the foreſight of <hi>Evil,</hi> and the Expectation of <hi>that,</hi> ſome years hence, makes the Time rather ſeem ſhort and near at hand: So many years to come, in the expectation and deſire of Good, are long and tedious; ſuch <hi>Hope deferred makes the Heart ſick;</hi> even tho' 'tis of that ſort as muſt needs fail our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Prepare me, Lord! for what thine unerring Counſel ſhall pleaſe to order, as to the remainder of my time on Earth; and ſuffer me not to count upon a great number of <hi>Years</hi> to come, ſince <hi>this,</hi> for ought I know, may be my laſt; neither let me expect Reſt and Happineſs in this World, which nothing Temporal can afford. This is not the ſtate or ſeaſon, wherein, by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, I am encouraged to hope it. And if <hi>fifty or threeſcore years</hi> to come, be thought ſo great a matter, and really is ſo, as to our ſtay on earth; Oh what apprehenſions ought I to admit concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an endleſs, <hi>everlaſting State!</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being as certain of the <hi>latter,</hi> after
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106982:31"/> Death, as I am uncertain about the <hi>former;</hi> whether ſo many Years be yet to come before my Death. Let me not herereafter be ſo prepoſterous in any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, Cares and Fears, as to be anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for to Morrow, and yet be thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Eternity.</p>

Ignorant Child-hood and heedleſs Youth, and infirm old Age, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take up a third part of that Time. In either of them very little of the great Ends of Life are anſwered. We ordinarily begin to reckon our Lives from our <hi>Birth;</hi> whereas for a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we know not whether we are alive or no, but are beholding to others to make the account for us. When we firſt come to the ſteady uſe of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or what we call the Years of Diſcretion; how few are there but from the Prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from the Corruption of Human Nature, from the want of Experience, from the Infection of bad Company, how few, I ſay, but ſpend their <hi>younger Years</hi> in thoſe things, which afterwards they are aſhamed of, when Experience hath taught them the Wiſdom of Men? How great a part of our remaining Time is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the Neceſſities of Nature about Food and Rayment, and in lawful Cares, to ſupport the Body? and how much more than needs, in pampering, dreſſing and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106982:32"/> adorning it? Out of the <hi>ſmall remainder,</hi> how much is imployed in the concerns of a Family and near Relations, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Callings, in neceſſary Civil Buſineſs, and in getting, keeping or improving an Eſtate? Beſides all the Time that is ſpent in Recreations, Viſits, unprofitable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, impertinent Thoughts, Journeys, Sickneſs, and innumerable other Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome allowable, ſome unavoidable, and many needleſs? After this, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time remains wherein to cultivate and improve our Minds, by Languages, Arts and Sciences, or the knowledg of a Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How <hi>little</hi> then after all, may we ſay, is left for the matters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> for Devotion to God, and ſerious preparation for another World? <hi>Alas!</hi> how ſmall a number of Years make up the Life of Man! and how ſmall a Portion of that is imployed about the Principal Buſineſs, for which we were born, and for which we live? We divide Time into Paſt, Preſent and Future: But the <hi>Past</hi> is not now ours; the <hi>Future</hi> is not <hi>yet,</hi> and the <hi>Preſent now</hi> is paſt, ere the ſound be pronounced. And yet this is <hi>all</hi> the Time allotted us, wherein to ſecure the Bleſſedneſs of Eternity. How many Hours more of our little Time might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106982:32"/> than commonly are by the Beſt? In every Year there are 8775 Hours: If we allow the greateſt half for Sleep and neceſſary attendance on the Body, and take but 4000 Hours for our Work and Buſineſs of conſequence: How poor an acconut can moſt Men give of all theſe 4000 Hours in every Year? not one hour in <hi>ſeven,</hi> not one in <hi>ten,</hi> is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily devoted to God, and the purpoſes of Religion.

               <p>IS the Life of Man ſo ſhort and fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Days on Earth ſo few, and ſo uncertain, how careful ſhould I be to manage every Hour; endeavouring to match the <hi>Swiftneſs</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> by my cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and diligence to improve it? I can have no Buſineſs of greater or of equal Moment to mind, than to ſecure the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my Soul in another World. And ſhall I laviſh my Time, and loſe my Pains about things unneceſſary? What will all other Buſineſs ſignifie in the end, if this be neglected? Is there any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt more weighty, that calleth me from ſuch work? Is there any thing elſe that ſo well deſerves my Time? That may be put into the Scales, or weighed in a balance againſt this? Shall <hi>Eternity,</hi> which comprehends all Time, have the leaſt ſhare of my Time allotted for its concernments? How little a part of my Time hath been hitherto employed in ſuch work! How reaſonable, how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106982:33"/> neceſſary is it to redeem the little Inch of Time that yet remains, but haſtens to a Period? For as there is no Covenant to be made with Death, ſo no Agreement for the Arreſt and Stay of Time; it keeps its pace whether I redeem and uſe it well or not. The greateſt part of our Life is deſignedly employed to avoid Death; we eat and drink, and ſleep, and labour, and reſt, that we may not die; and yet even by theſe we haſten to Death. Every Breath, every Pulſe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word leaves one leſs of the number which God hath appointed me, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away ſome Sands of the Glaſs of Time; and yet how little care is taken to employ it well? We ſeldom value it, till we can no longer uſe it to any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and though we know it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be retarded in its motion, or recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when paſt, yet of nothing are we more prodigal. Yea, how many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it as a Burden, and know not what to do with their Time, are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at a loſs wherein to employ it, what to do to be rid of it? But alas! how near is that Change, when they ſhall think nothing too dear to purchaſe ſome few Grains of that Sand, which now ſeem too many, while they are paſſing through
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106982:34"/> their Hour-glaſs? How ſad will be the review of our loſt and ill-ſpent Time? How different an Opinion of its Value ſhall we have on a ſick-Bed, or when our Time and Hope is gone? How many Weeks, and Days, and Hours, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> have I trifled away in Sloth and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs, in fooliſh Mirth, and hurtful Company, in vain Thoughts and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Diſcourſe, in exceſs of Sleep, and needleſs Paſtimes, Feaſtings, inordinate Care to adorn the Body, or gratifie the ſenſual Appetite? All that which is paſt is irrecoverable; and the little remainder flies apace. How quickly will it be gone? How ſoon, how ſuddenly may an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Stroke of Death conclude it? And yet this is all the opportunity I ſhall ever have to make my Peace with God, and prepare for the everlaſting World. Did we conſider it as we ought, we ſhould not fooliſhly throw away ſo much of it in Trifles and things impertinent, or what is worſe: How much more might we redeem than commonly we do? To how much better purpoſe might we huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it? How much more work might we do, were we never idle, or did not loyter? We might walk far, did we not often ſtand ſtill, or go out of our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106982:34"/> way. We ſee it plainly by the great and excellent Effects of ſome few mens Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in every Age. Art hath found mean to ſet Spies and Watches as it were on the <hi>Sun,</hi> that he cannot look out, but they take hold of his <hi>Shadow,</hi> and force it to tell how far he is gone that day; and yet while we are curious in making Time give a juſt account of it ſelf to us, how little do we conſider the account of our Time which we muſt ſhortly give to God? Oh that ſuch a Thought might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perſuade me to redeem it! that I may not tarry till the end of Time to know the worth of it! Let me not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value it, while tis given me to be uſed, that I may not eternally regret my Folly, when Time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>God calls me to Diligence and Labour; the <hi>Work</hi> he calls me to is excellent, and the <hi>Reward</hi> glorious; to know, and love, and ſerve, and obey him, in order to eternal Life; and ſhall I yet be idle? Is this the Uſe and End of all my Time? And do I know it and believe it? Do I indeed believe it, and yet delay and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and waſte my precious Hours in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Am I going into <hi>Eternity,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into another World, and know that I muſt be in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106982:35"/> ever, and have I Time to throw away? Am I fit to die, and to appear before my Judge, or am I not? Am I made meet for Heaven by pardoning Mercy, and ſanctifying Grace? Have I the Earneſt of the Spirit to witneſs and aſſure me of it? Is my Intereſt in the Promiſe of Eternal Life as firm, and my Evidence of it as clear as it may be made? Am I not conſcious to my ſelf, that much of this neceſſary Work is yet to be done? And ſhall ſuch an unprepared Soul as mine be careleſs and indifferent how I ſpend my Time?</p>

                  <hi>VII.</hi> Of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Heaven, Day and Night, Summer and Winter, Seed Time and Harveſt; their order and ſucceſſion eſtabliſht by God, is the effect of Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs. What they may teach us.</head>
               <p>WHen I conſider the beginning of another Year, I can hardly avoid reflecting of its ſeveral parts, Summer and Winter, Spring and Fall, Day and Night, and their alternate Turns. This calls me to obſerve and admire his Eternal Power and Godhead, Wiſdom and Truth who is the Great Author of this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable variety; Who hath fixed the Earth whith his Foot, and hanged it on nothing. and ſetled the Luminaries of Heaven for Excellent Ends: <hi>The Sun to Rule by day, and the Moon by Night,</hi> thereby to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Times and Seaſons, to ſeperate Day and Night, Winter and Summer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the convenience of Man and Beaſt by their due ſucceſſion. <hi>The Day is thine, the Night alſo is thine, thou makeſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter:</hi> How wonderful is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106982:36"/> their Order, Beauty and conſtant courſe, that when the Sun withdraws, and the ſhadows of the Evening cover the Earth with darkneſs, to conclude the <hi>Day;</hi> the Moon and Stars ſupply the place of the abſent Sun during the <hi>Night:</hi> and that tho they differ in length, yet gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leſſen till they are both equal at the years end, and have made the ſame Circuit. How excellent a work of God is that quick ſucceſſion to one another?</p>
               <p>The ſuppoſition of a <hi>perpetual night,</hi> is a diſmal gloomy Thought. O what will the Everlaſting Darkneſs of the Infernal Priſon be! The Sun by day enlightens the Earth, directs our motion, guides our way, governs our Travail, aſſiſts Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, awakens Induſtry, warms the Earth and Air, gives life, and vigor, and fruitfulneſs to all things under the Sun, and makes the whole Inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rejoyce. An Emblem of God's univerſal Goodneſs, who is kind to all his Creatures. How admirable is its Luſtre! how glorious is its Light! how loudly doth it proclaim his Power and Wiſdom! who made this, and the other Lights of Heaven, his powerful Word, and preſerves them hitherto by his daily Providence. If God be now ſo glorious,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106982:36"/> contemplated in his works, conſidered in the luſtre of the created Sun, viewed only through the Windows of Senſe; how much more glorious will he appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when we ſhall ſee him face to face, and nothing interpoſe btwixt us and his incomparable Light! If mine Eyes dazle to look upon the meridian Sun, in what inacceſſible Light muſt he dwell, who is <hi>the Father of Lights?</hi> If this lower World, the common receptacle of his Friends and Enemies, have ſo much of his Glory vouchſafed them by the Heavenly Bodies; O what a place will <hi>Heaven</hi> be, where ſhall be no <hi>Sun or Moon</hi> nor need of any, <hi>but the Glory of God ſhall lighten it, and the Lamb be the Light thereof?</hi> While I thus conſider the Sun and the Day, I muſt not think the <hi>Night</hi> is uſeleſs, which diſcovers another part of the Heavens, not diſcernible by Day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Stars and Planets, refreſhing the Earth, cooling the Air, giving neceſſary Reſt to the Creatures &amp;c. their order, motions, aſpects, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, influences, are all uſeful, and inſtructive. The agreeable mixture of Light and Darkneſs, the regular ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Day and Night within a few hours are exceeding wonderful and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. In other parts of the World, where the Sun beams are more direct
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106982:37"/> and its Heat exceſſive, God hath made amends by the length of the <hi>night,</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Equinoctial Line it is always Twelve hours) and in the more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts, where the Influence of the Sun is weaker, the <hi>days</hi> are proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably longer. So good is God to all his Creatures, in all parts of the world! As the Morning and Evening anſwer to the day of Twenty four hours; ſo doth Spring and Autumn to the Twelve Months of the Year, that we may not paſs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from one extreme to another; but gradually be diſpoſed for ſo great a change, as is between Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Winter and Summer. So merciful and gracious, and infinitely wiſe is God in all his Works! ſo that we cannot ſay, one part of the Year is more neceſſary than another. The <hi>winter</hi> is as uſeful for the good of the Univerſe, as the <hi>ſummer:</hi> In this we are ſupplied with what is neceſſary to maintain us in that, and the admirable ſituation of the Sun, (moſt probably) in the Center of the World, ſeems much to contribute to it. If it had been at a farther diſtance from us, our earth would have been in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſolate; be cauſe the influence of the Sun could not have been conſiderable:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106982:37"/> And if it had been nearer, the Stars above would have wanted Light, and this Earth under, been burnt up. The Excellent order which it hath now obeyed for above ſix Thouſand Years, is alſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful. The Sun never ſtood ſtill but once, and that by a miracle; Tho much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that of its daily Progreſs. What a ſubject is here to admire the Power, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Faithfulneſs of God? <hi>Lord! what is Man!</hi> for whom thou doſt all this? And becauſe I find every year that the Day dies into Night, the Summer into Winter, and herbs and plants loſe their beauty and verdure, and ſhed their bloſſoms; may I not hence learn to conſider and prepare for my own approaching Change? In proſperity, health, and eaſe, and life, to expect, and make proviſion for trouble, ſickneſs, pain, and Death? as every wiſe man in Summer would do for Winter; and work all my might, <hi>while it is called to day,</hi> while the Light continues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Night of darkneſs is at hand, when none can work.</p>

Were we delivered from <hi>Sin,</hi> the ſting of Death, by having made our Peace with God in the Blood of Jeſus, Death would not be frightful, or put on ſuch a ghaſtly Vizor, as to moſt it doth. But we are uncertain of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> we waver between hopes and fears as to our final Sentence; and are conſcious to our ſelves that we are <hi>not ready</hi> for our great Account. This makes Death ſo terrible.

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:106982:44"/>
               <p>But tho' I know that within a few years at fartheſt I muſt leave this World by one or other of theſe ways; tho' I have been dying ever ſince I began to live; am Dead to the laſt year, and to all the preceding Portions of my Time; and know withal, that what remains will quickly paſs and be gone, after the ſame manner; yet how have I overloved this Body, as if I ſhould never live out of it! and ſet my Heart and Affections on this World, as if I ſhould never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to another! and trifled away my precious Time and Life, as if a change would never come!</p>
               <p>That few do ſeriouſly admit ſuch thoughts is too evident, by the general courſe and practice of their Lives. For to what hazards do Men expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? what pains will they take? what Inconveniences will they bear? with what unwearied Induſtry will they toyl and labour, to get a little Money, or Honour in this World, tho' they know not but they may be called out of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of <hi>this</hi> Year? And yet the ſame Perſons are remiſs and ſlothful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a future Life; negligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned about an Eternal ſtate; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and indifferent, yea ſottiſhly ſtupid,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106982:44"/> about the welfare of their Immortal Souls. Henceforward, O my Soul! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other others do, let me reſolve to live in the expectation of a <hi>Change,</hi> which I know is <hi>certain,</hi> and may be very <hi>near.</hi>

               <p>LET me retire a little, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> and bethink my ſelf, what a World this is; what Men deſign and ſeek, and do and ſuffer; with what falſe and feigned Joys they are pleaſed, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy by compariſon; and with what real Sorrows they are afflicted; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable diſappointments, ſickneſſes, (and as troubleſome remedies,) dangers, labors, pains, and calamities of all ſorts, Multitudes groan under, and loudly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of? and what little unworthy ends are purſued by all that do not ſeriouſly ſeek Eternal Reſt? and how often fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106982:45"/> And withal conſider the Cares that diſquiet us, the errors that deceive us, the many Temptations that aſſault and overcome us; how buſie we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Vanities; how often dejected, and melancholy for the breaking of a Bubble; how eager and induſtrious to purſue a Shadow; active and in earneſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our ſelves, and one another; and then reflect on the Malice, and cruelty, the Filthineſs, and Impiety, and great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which abounds every where; whereby God is diſhonoured, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokt to Anger? After this what a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater of <hi>Tragedies,</hi> muſt this World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? what an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of ſick, and diſeaſed, or rather diſtracted Perſons? How ſhould I be tempted to ſay, <hi>Lord! why haſt thou made all Men in vain?</hi> If I could not look from this Sea of troubles, to the Haven of Reſt; from this dark Priſon, to the Region of Light; from this deceitful, troubleſome, and defiling <hi>Earth,</hi> to a Bleſſed, Everlaſting <hi>Heaven:</hi> For <hi>verily,</hi> if there be no World but this, <hi>every Man in his beſt Eſtate</hi> in this World, <hi>is altogether Vanity, Selah. Pſal.</hi> 39.5. 'Tis a certain undoubted Truth, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed <hi>verily</hi> tells us ſo; and that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be well conſidered, we learn from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106982:45"/> the concluding <hi>Selah, Every Man is Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Not the Inferior parts of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only; But <hi>Man</hi> the Lord of all: And <hi>Every Man,</hi> every <hi>Adam</hi> from himſelf, to the laſt Man that ſhall by ordinary Generation deſcend from him. Not the Ignorant, Poor, or Wicked only, but <hi>all</hi> the Individuals of this Species. Young or Old, ſtrong or weak, beautiful or deformed, rich or poor, high or low, good or bad, (in reſpect of the Body, and this preſent Life,) every one is <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and this is true, ſuppoſe him in his <hi>Beſt Eſtate,</hi> not only in helpleſs Infancy and Childhood, or in decrepit old Age, not only in pain, and poverty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; but in his moſt ſetled, moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, moſt envied, and admired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon Earth; in the midſt of ſtrength, and wit, and honour; when at <hi>beſt,</hi> as to body, and mind, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumſtances; when he looks faireſt, when he ſhines brighteſt; in the height of all his Glory, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt likelihood of a Continuance; yet <hi>then</hi> he is but <hi>vanity.</hi> In his frame, in his temper, conſtitution, inclinations, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and imployment; he is a meer <hi>Shadow,</hi> an empty, mutable, inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, and not to be accounted of.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106982:46"/> His Heart, his head, his imaginations, reaſonings, deſires, purpoſes, projects, hopes, and fears, are all <hi>Vanity;</hi> and <hi>altogether Vanity,</hi> in all the parts, and kinds, and particulars of it. He not only <hi>may</hi> be, but <hi>he is ſo,</hi> in his <hi>beſt Eſtate:</hi> if this World be his <hi>Best;</hi> if this be <hi>our All,</hi> and nothing more to be expected after death. And how ſhould ſuch a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrike me to the Heart, to ſuppoſe that after a few years are ended, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my firſt Nothing, and my very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Vid.

What delight can I have in the ordinary comforts of Life, with this Belief, that within a year or two, it may be to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I ſhall ſink into the duſt, and exiſt no more? What Pleaſure in any thing with this diſmal Expectation? The more flouriſhing my condition is in this World, the more ſhould I dread to loſe it, if nothing better, nothing at all, can be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106982:46"/> injoyed after Death. Some Philoſophers have ignorantly urged ſuch a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the fear of death; but the admiſſion of it may rather deprive a Man of all the comfort of Life. What then is the advantage of a Wiſe Man above a Fool? the exerciſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our nobleſt Faculties would render us more miſerable than others, if nothing be expected, and certain, when this Life is over. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſual, but intellectual Pleaſures would be diſturbed and deſtroyed by ſuch Thoughts; that very ſhortly, the next Year, or Day, I muſt diſappear; and all my Injoyments and Hopes be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and for ever loſt, with my very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Were the caſe thus, (which ſuch Conſequences evince it is not,) it were better for moſt Men they had never been Born; whether their condition here be Proſperous, or Afflicted. For what Comfort or quiet can any Man have in Plenty and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> when this fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſion of an approaching end is ever preſent? and what conſolation can it yield a Man who is afflicted and <hi>Calamitous,</hi> and yet loves his <hi>Life</hi> above all things; to think that he ſhall not ceaſe to be <hi>miſerable,</hi> but by ceaſing to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106982:47"/> 
                  <hi>be?</hi> And what is become of all <hi>Religion,</hi> if ſuch a thought be entertained? All devotion to God is thereby extinguiſht, all the reſtraints of vice removed, the Flood-gates of Impiety opened, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Vertue, the rewards of Holineſs; the Foundation of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuffering for Righteouſneſs ſake; all at once taken away. <hi>Lord!</hi> confirm my Belief of the inviſible future ſtate of Rewards and Puniſhments! and let not <hi>Sadduciſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> damp my zeal in thy ſervice, or rob me of the comforts of <hi>this Life,</hi> which, if I have any ſolid ones, muſt ſuppoſe the hopes of a <hi>Better.</hi> Let others therefore, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> who expect not an Everlaſting Heaven beyond the Grave, place their affections on Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and mind this World, as if there were no betrer, no other. Let them who doubt, or disbelieve the promiſed rewards of <hi>Eternity,</hi> take up with what they muſt ſhortly leave, and labour for the Bread that periſheth. But ſince I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe and ſeek the <hi>Life Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> let me daily entertain my ſelf with the hopes of it, and let all the flattering dreams of what is deſirable upon Earth, give place to nobler and better thoughts.

What inſtructions we may learn by the ſight of a <hi>dead Carkaſs,</hi> or a <hi>Deaths Head,</hi> and the uſual Motto on it: and what by the Death of <hi>Holy</hi> Perſons, to quicken our deſires to be as they.</head>
               <p>HAth divine Patience added <hi>one year</hi> more to the number of my Days, when ſo many others were removed by Death the <hi>laſt</hi> Year? Others, whom a few Months ſince I knew in vigorous health; wiſer, ſtronger, more likely to live, and to anſwer the ends of Life than me; ſome of them, my near Relations, and uſeful Friends; in whoſe converſe I took delight, and promiſed my ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their Company and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; But they are taken, and I am left. <hi>Thy Holy Will,</hi> O Lord! <hi>is done:</hi> and they, who were prepared, are infinite Gainers by this my loſs. Quicken my preparations by following their Piety, to meet them in thy Heavenly Kingdom. Let thy long-ſuffering lead me to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106982:48"/> and ſuffer me not to ſlight thy warning by the <hi>Death of others,</hi> to expect my <hi>own. Lord!</hi> cure my Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, and practical unbelief; and by all ſuch admonitions of thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, teach me to poſſeſs, and uſe this World, as knowing I muſt ſhortly leave it; and let not the thoughts of my Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality wear off, aſſoon as the Funeral of my Friends is over.</p>
               <p>Every year ſome or other of our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> drop into the Grave, we attend them thither, and lament, it may be, for a few days, their departure and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; but conſider not, that others will e're be long do the ſame for us; it may before <hi>this</hi> year is ended. Oh how ſoon do we forget our deceaſed Friends, and <hi>our ſelves,</hi> who are likewiſe dying! and count upon a long Life, which we cannot reaſonably expect; and hug the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this tranſitory World, as if our preſent ſtate would laſt for ever! Will nothing but our own diſſolution effectually convince us of our miſtake, and folly, in this particular?</p>
               <p>Though the Arrows of Death flye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually round about us; ſometimes over our <hi>Heads,</hi> when Superiours are taken away; ſometimes fall at our <hi>Feet,</hi> when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106982:49"/> Children and Servants, and Inferiours die; ſometimes on our <hi>Left hand,</hi> when an Enemy is cut off; and while I am pleaſed with that, in that very hour, it may be, another Arrow on our <hi>Right hand</hi> ſtrikes the Friend of our Boſom and Delight. And can we ſee all this, that great and ſmall, high and low, friends and foes are all Vanity, and drop down dead round about us; and ſhall we not conſider, that <hi>we</hi> are as <hi>Vain</hi> as <hi>they,</hi> and muſt ſhortly follow? Shall we not by a Chriſtian <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> extract Spirits out of theſe dead Bones? and by theſe Examples learn <hi>the End of all Men,</hi> and lay it to Heart?</p>
               <p>Whenever I ſee the <hi>Funeral</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let me think thus with my ſelf; why might not I have been that Man or Woman, that is now carried to the Grave? If we had been compared a few days ſince, 'tis probable I ſhould have been thought as likely to have been his <hi>Monitor,</hi> by dying firſt, as he mine. By ſuch an improvement of theſe warnings, the requeſt of the rich Man to <hi>Abraham</hi> were in great meaſure granted; for 'tis a call from the dead that ſpeaks loudly to us, to conſider our ſelves, and prepare in time for ſo great a change: and ſay, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106982:49"/> to <hi>Hezekiah, Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can we look upon a <hi>Deaths Head,</hi> and not remember what we ſhall ſhortly be? may not much be learnt from its common Motto? <hi>Sum quod Eris, Fueramque quod Es. I am that which thou ſhalt ſhortly be, and have been that which thou art now:</hi> that is, I have been as gay and jocund, as brisk and merry, as proud and vain, as rich and great, as careleſs and ſecure, as honourable and as much eſteemed, as beautifull and as well beloved, as witty and as learned, as <hi>Thou art</hi> or canſt be <hi>now.</hi> I valued my ſelf as much upon my Eſtate and Trade, and health, and beauty; upon my Education, Profeſſion, Imployments, Parts, Friends, Family &amp;c. <hi>as thou</hi> haſt ever done, or canſt do: I lived in eaſe and pleaſure, in mirth and jollity; I min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the World as much, and indulged my ſelf as much in ſenſuality; and was as careful of my Body, pampered and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Fleſh as much <hi>as thou,</hi> and thought as little of a ſudden Death, and prepared as little for ſuch a change, <hi>as thou doſt:</hi> but now my dry Bones are lookt upon with contempt and ſcorn, but <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt ſhortly return to duſt, and be as vile as I am.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106982:50"/>
               <p>It cannot but affect us, did we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, to ſee divers ſnatch'd away in their <hi>Youth,</hi> and outward <hi>Proſperity;</hi> and in the midſt of their <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> without any viſible ſigns of true <hi>Repentance:</hi> Or in terrible anguiſh and horror for their paſt crimes: And yet how few do take the warning, carefully to prevent the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs? <hi>O Lord!</hi> preſerve thoſe ſtrong Convictions, thoſe ſerious Thoughts, thoſe holy Reſolutions, thoſe lively Apprehenſions of the Life to come, of the Evil of ſin, and the Terrors of thy wrath, which the Sight of dying perſons hath at any time awakened in my ſoul! O the <hi>Eloquence</hi> of a <hi>dying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> to perſuade to <hi>Repentance!</hi> Even when he hath loſt his <hi>Speech,</hi> and lies gaſping, and trembling, on a bed of ſickneſs; breathing out his laſt faint breath, and paſſing into the other world, to anſwer for the crimes and follies of a wicked Life! <hi>Lord!</hi> revive theſe thoughts upon my ſoul, and let me feel the power and influence of them, in the hour of <hi>Temptation,</hi> and in every time of need! And let the conſideration of <hi>the death of Believers,</hi> the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> they are thereby entred into, and the <hi>Holineſs</hi> they are poſſeſſed of, quicken my deſires
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106982:50"/> and diligence to prepare to follow. When I think where <hi>they</hi> are, and what they are doing, what is their work, and what their ſtate, what their continual imployment, and what their Injoyments; and how different from ours: I cannot but wiſh to be with them; to be as they are, and do as they do, to know and love and praiſe God <hi>as they.</hi> They are not hindred by ſuch a clog as <hi>this Body</hi> is to us; or tempted by their ſenſes, appetite and fancy, to ſin againſt him: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not of a ſeducing fleſh, unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, low and diſordered thoughts, of Temporal Afflictions, ſpiritual Deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſnares of the World, and the malice and ſubtility of the Devil: <hi>We</hi> who are <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Travellers</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to theſe difficulties, and ſtorms which <hi>they</hi> are freed from. They are now rejoycing in the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſhall never queſtion his love more, while we are in Tears and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, groaning to be delivered.</p>
               <p>But think, <hi>O my ſoul!</hi> that <hi>They were</hi> lately ſuch as <hi>We are now.</hi> They <hi>were</hi> members of the militant Church, before they entred into Joy and Triumph. They <hi>had</hi> their conflicts and difficulties, their hour of Temptation, and time of trial, as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106982:51"/> we have <hi>ours.</hi> They <hi>were</hi> ſlandered, and perſecuted, and ſadned, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as their Followers are: They went to Heaven the ſame way, and got the victory after the ſame manner, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Faith, and humble perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Obedience. <hi>They were</hi> once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect as we are now; and complained of the Body of Sin and Death, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of unmortified luſt, as we do: And were ſometimes in the dark about their intereſt in the promiſe, and walked hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily by the hiding of Gods face, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured Temptation, <hi>even as we.</hi> And as we have nothing to do, or ſuffer, but what they met with; we have the ſame encouragement, that adminiſtred to their ſupport; the ſame God and Saviour, the ſame way and rule, the ſame aſſiſtance, by the aids of his H. Spirit, offered to us; the ſame promiſes, and the ſame rewards propoſed, which they enjoyed, firſt in faith and hope, and afterwards in fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea they paſſed through the dark valley, and ſo muſt we: Their Earthly tabernacle was diſſolved, and ſo muſt ours be. We muſt expect to go <hi>the ſame way</hi> to Reſt and Glory; and wait Gods Time for our admiſſion. We muſt finiſh firſt the work which God hath for us to do
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106982:51"/> and ſuffer, and then all Tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes, we ſhall <hi>grieve no more,</hi> we ſhall <hi>ſin no more,</hi> but be as the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, or as the Spirits of the Juſt made Perfect.</p>

               <p>I <hi>May dye this Year:</hi> then all my Cares and Fears, if I am <hi>Rich,</hi> all my Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and calamities as to this World, if I am <hi>Poor,</hi> will die too. <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> then I ſhall have no more Enemies, no more Sickneſs, and which is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall <hi>Sin</hi> no more. <hi>I must</hi> ſhortly <hi>die,</hi> it may be, <hi>this Year:</hi> but there is no other way to come to a bleſſed Life but by dying; and my Saviour hath dyed for me, and he that believes in him, ſhall never ſee death. He lives who was once dead, yea he lives for evermore, and hath promiſed, that I ſhall be with him to behold his Glory. He hath the Keys of Death and Hell: He is the Reſurrection and the Life; he hath removed the ſting of Death; and I need not fear a conquered Enemy. <hi>If I dye this Year,</hi> I muſt quit the Company
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106982:54"/> of all my deareſt <hi>Friends</hi> on Earth; but I ſhall go to <hi>better Company</hi> above: and if they are the Friends of Chriſt, we ſhall ſhortly <hi>meet</hi> again, and love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in a better manner than now, and never more be parted. <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> my <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> may dye too. Let me enjoy the <hi>one</hi> as mortal dying Perſons, that muſt e're long leave me, or I them: and not fear the <hi>other,</hi> who may ſo ſoon Periſh, and quickly be uncapable of doing me or others Miſchief. <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> let me not then think much of <hi>Temporal Sufferings,</hi> of any Evils which may ſo ſoon be over. Oh what would condemned Sinners in the other World give to be able to believe and ſay ſo of their Sufferings! <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> and can I wonder that I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Sick</hi> and in <hi>Pain,</hi> and that my <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> is out of order? Am I not Mortal, and dwell in an houſe of Clay, which muſt ſhortly moulder into Duſt? and is it any thing ſtrange, that ſuch a <hi>craſy Building</hi> doth ſometime ſhake, and need repair, and threaten a diſſolution? 'Tis a greater wonder, I am any time well: That ſuch a Body, compounded of ſo many little parts, and ſo eaſily diſordered by innumerable accidents, ſhould be in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106982:55"/> Health, is hardly leſs to be admired, than that an Inſtrument of a thouſand ſtrings ſhould be kept in Tune. I thank thee, <hi>O Heavenly Father!</hi> for the many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> to weaken the power of Sin, to humble my Pride, and cure my Worldlineſs and Senſuality, to reduce me from wandering, to empty me of Self-conceit, to awaken the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death and Judgment, to impreſs the Thoughts of the Vanity of this World, and the Eternity of the next, to aſſiſt me to mortifie the Fleſh, to rule my Paſſions, to exerciſe Patience, and quicken Prayer, and try my Faith and Love, and excite my diligence to redeem Time, and convince me of the Worth and Uncertainty of it, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote my Preparations for my final change. The Great Apoſtle by <hi>dying dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> had as many victories over this World, as he lived Days. Oh that I might ſo far walk by the ſame Rule, as every day to think of providing for my laſt! and in Health to do that which in Sickneſs I ſhall wiſh I had done!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> It may be by ſome tedious painful Sickneſs, ſome trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and loathſome Diſeaſe. But God hath promiſed his Grace ſhall be ſufficient; he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106982:55"/> will make my Bed in my Sickneſs; and put under his everlaſting Arms for my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and not ſuffer me to be tempted above what I am able: he will encreaſe my Patience and carry me thro' the pangs of Death, and the dark valley, and <hi>when Heart and Fleſh fail, be the strength of my Heart, and my Portion for Ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I may dye this year:</hi> What if it ſhould be by an hand of <hi>Violence;</hi> if for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake, in defence of the Truth, for a good Cauſe, and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and my Peace be made with God, and I am accuſed for doing well, or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Evil which is laid to my charge; there is ground enough for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſupport. Thouſands of my <hi>Betters</hi> have met with the like, whoſe names are precious and renowned. Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have dyed by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>a Judge,</hi> with more Chearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Joy, than <hi>others,</hi> or it may be, than <hi>they themſelves,</hi> would have done, by the ſentence of the <hi>Phyſician.</hi> The Torture of many Diſeaſes is unſpeakably more formidable, as to the meer Pain, and for all elſe, the Righteous Lord who loveth Righteouſneſs, will clear my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, if it may beſt ſubſerve his own Great and Holy ends: at leaſt he will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106982:56"/> ſtand by and help me, when all forſake me; and if he ſpeak <hi>Peace,</hi> and give <hi>inward Conſolation,</hi> who can ſpeak <hi>Trouble?</hi> and his final Judgment, which is near at hand, will diſtribute rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to all, according to their works.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe farther, that I ſhould <hi>want a Sepulcher,</hi> after Death. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I could better be without. If God receive my <hi>Soul,</hi> and will raiſe my <hi>Body</hi> at the laſt day, whether it putrifie and conſume under ground, or above it, is no great matter. They who are alive will be more concerned in that, than I ſhall be; Graves are for the ſake of the <hi>Living</hi> rather than the Dead. The Sun, the Rain, the Air, Birds, Beaſts, Worms, will all contribute to give me <hi>Burial,</hi> if Men deny it. The only difference is, that it will be a little longer ere I am bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. If my Soul reſt in the Boſom of my Saviour, and by perſevering in the love and practice of the Truth, I have ſecured my Reputation with wiſe and good Men, I need not be ſollicitous what become of my Body. My Almighty Judge will raiſe me a <hi>glorious Body,</hi> like his own, and reunite it to my Soul; As eaſily, as certainly, as for any of thoſe, whoſe Bodies were preſerved in Caves
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106982:56"/> and Vaults, in proud Sepulchers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtately Monuments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I may dye this Year;</hi> and ſhall not then have the ſatisfaction to ſee my <hi>Children</hi> or neareſt <hi>Kindred</hi> educated and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, ſetled and diſpoſed of. But is not the <hi>Everliving God</hi> the ſame? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he <hi>as well</hi> take care of them when I am gone, as now? anſwer all my Prayers after my deceaſe? and exerciſe that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care, Wiſdom, and Love, which ſhall diſpoſe of their conditions, ſave them from Temptations, and ſupply all their wants, and exceed all my deſires, in reference to them? and fulfill his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promiſe from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to the Childrens Children of them that fear him? O how <hi>weak</hi> is my <hi>Faith,</hi> that cannot truſt God in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and plain a caſe!</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>I may dye this Year:</hi> and not live to ſee the ruin of the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom,</hi> and Intereſt, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of many Excellent Promiſes, which concern the Reſt, and Peace, and Purity and Glory of the Churches of Chriſt on earth in the latter days. But have I not deſerved by my provoking Unbelief, Ingratitude, and Diſobedience, to dye in the Wilderneſs, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106982:57"/> behold the promiſed Land, or ſee the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> and will not the ſtruglings of Satan to ſupport <hi>Babylon,</hi> infer a diſmal night of darkneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, before the expected Morning of Deliverance? ſo that it may now, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, be truly ſaid, <hi>Henceforth, Bleſſed are the Dead who dye in the Lord.</hi> And if God will take me to himſelf in the other World, I cannot poſſibly be a loſer: tho' I ſhould not ſee the Beginnings of <hi>a New Heaven, and a New Earth,</hi> in this. However I rejoyce in <hi>Hope,</hi> and pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly for the Reſurrection of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the rebuilding of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the more plentiful effuſion of the <hi>H.

Which of his Companions ſhall next follow, we know not, or how ſoon. Lord! make me apprehend the nearneſs of my change in every place: and if I am prepared for dying, no matter <hi>where</hi> it be. There is no one Country farther from the Preſence of God than another. The whole World may be conſidered as one Great Houſe, and the ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Countries of it, but as different <hi>Apartments</hi> in the ſame Houſe: and they who tarry at home are no more exempt from <hi>Death,</hi> than they who travel abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fullneſs thereof;</hi> I can go no where to be out of his Territories, I ſhall ſtill tread upon my Fathers's Ground. I had rather be an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in a Wilderneſs with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, than a Courtier in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Aegypt. Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and the friend of God, was baniſhed from his own Country; and ſhould I never ſet foot again on my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soyl, there is no reaſon of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106982:58"/> againſt my God, who hath dealt thus with many of his Favourites. And while I have been in a ſtrange Land, he hath not ſuffered me to feel the wants and neceſſities, and <hi>heart of a Stranger.</hi> Among a People of a ſtrange Language he can, and doth provide for me all things richly to enjoy. I may ſet up my <hi>Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer,</hi> Hitherto hath God ſupplied all my wants.</p>
               <p>The Preſence of my Gracious Father is every where the <hi>ſame:</hi> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Bleſſed be my God,</hi> I have hitherto found it ſo. And may I not rejoice in God in a Deſert, though all the World ſhould forſake me; though all the World ſhould be againſt me? Should I have no other Friend or Helper; is not <hi>God,</hi> an infinite God <hi>Enough?</hi> and without his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Preſence, what can all this World do for me? If I am <hi>ſick,</hi> and in danger of Death, among my <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> if <hi>the comforts of the Almighty</hi> do not refreſh and delight my Soul, <hi>they</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: and if I want not <hi>theſe</hi> in my laſt Agonies, no matter in what part or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Earth I breath my laſt. If the word and promiſe of God be my Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an holy Hope my Anchor, Chriſt my Pilot, and Heaven my Country, I ſhall not

Suffer me not to forſake thee, <hi>O Heavenly Father!</hi> while I live; and do not thou forſake me in my <hi>laſt Hour;</hi> and let it come <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> thou wilt! If my bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will receive my departing Soul at Death, I am not ſollicitous in what Country, or part of the Earth it be.</p>
               <p>And that I may not be unwilling in the flower of my Age and Time, <hi>in Youth and Strength,</hi> to leave this World; let me think often, that no one age or part of Life is more priviledged againſt the ſtroke of Death than another. If I have done my work betimes, as my deceaſed <hi>Fellow Traveller</hi> had, is it not better to receive the Bleſſed Recompence, than to tarry longer, in a World of Sin and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, abſent from the Lord? Shall I not thereby eſcape a multitude of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Sins, and Sorrows, which others by living longer are expoſed to? If my Peace be made with God, what ſhould make me willing to live at this diſtance from him? What ſhould render this World ſo deſirable, where God is ſo diſhonoured, where I am ſo often tempted to diſpleaſe him, and ſo often yield to ſuch Temptations? And may I not fear leſt I ſhould fall into ſuch ſcandalous and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106982:59"/> grievous ſins, that may bring a publick reproach on the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſadden the Hearts of all my Acquaintance who love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity? By dying early, I ſhall contract leſs guilt, and commit leſs <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſee and feel leſs <hi>Sorrow</hi> than others who live longer. And tho' I ſhould maintain my Integrity, yet in this World my higheſt love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and my ſweeteſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, is but imperfect. How many impediments and Diverſions do I daily meet with, that deaden my Heart to Heavenly Contemplations and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? What diſappointments, and ſorrowful diſaſters, to convince me that <hi>this</hi> is not the place of Reſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? What ſmart afflictions may ſome of my <hi>Relations</hi> prove? What dangerous Snares may attend me in the remaining Portion of my Time? What Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hatred from Men may the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt profeſſing of the Truth, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to God expoſe me to? What publick national Calamities may I have my ſhare in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if I conſider <hi>old Age</hi> it ſelf, which we do deſire to reach; what and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the Infirmities and Griefs, and troubleſome Circumſtances which attend
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106982:60"/> that State, which dying young will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? Are not moſt Men who reach a very great old Age, helpleſs objects of Pity? A Burthen to themſelves, and to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them? And (which commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,) may I not <hi>then</hi> be as unwilling to dye, as at preſent? As loth <hi>then</hi> to leave the World as <hi>now,</hi> tho' in a manner it will have left me? For how many old Men, paſt the reliſh of ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are yet inordinately fond of a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Life!</p>
               <p>Have I not been told by <hi>Heathens,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that 'tis not the length of time, but its improvement, that doth really make a <hi>Long Life?</hi> If I have anſwered the ends for which I were born, 'tis not <hi>too ſoon</hi> to dye. No Man ever miſcarried as to his Everlaſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, becauſe his <hi>Life</hi> was <hi>ſhort,</hi> but <hi>Evil.</hi> He that is prepared for Death, he that dies <hi>in the Lord</hi> hath lived long enough, and ſhould thank God for a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> call to the poſſeſſion of that <hi>Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which the Holieſt Saints on Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and breath after. <hi>Gideon</hi> loſt nothing by returning from Victory, <hi>while the Sun was yet high.</hi> He hath fought long enough who hath gained the Victory. If I have wrought but a few hours in a Vineyard,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106982:60"/> and done but a little Service for my Lord and Maſter; and yet am diſmiſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, before the reſt of my Fellow Labourers; ſhall I repine, and think my Lord doth not befriend me? If he hath any farther Service for me, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my days, and make me diligent, I hope, and <hi>contented.</hi> Otherwiſe I pray he would make me ready to dye, and make me <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>deſirous</hi> to depart this Life. For to be only <hi>content</hi> to dye, that I may be perfectly Holy, and fully Bleſſed, is methinks too low for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who acts like himſelf, believing the Certainty of his avowed Principles and Hopes, and knowing that <hi>while we are preſent in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi>

It may convince us, that we are <hi>Cruel</hi> and unkind to our very <hi>Bodies,</hi> by overloving them, becauſe we thereby contribute to their Eternal Sufferings: and ſo teach us to love and uſe our Bodies, as Servants to our Souls in this World; and as expecting to ſhare in Glory with them, after the Reſurrection. It may alſo help to <hi>moderate</hi> our <hi>Deſires</hi> after Earthly Good, and ſo cure the <hi>Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> by letting us ſee the vanity, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and ſhort duration of theſe things, and their inſufficiency to make us Happy, and give us true Content.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts of an approaching Change may, if any thing will do it,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106982:62"/> damp the mirth of the <hi>Luxurious Epicure,</hi> and ſtrike him into a fit of trembling, as did <hi>Belſhazzar's</hi> handwriting on the wall. It may diſcover the diſtraction of living in Pleaſure, and of care to pleaſe the Senſes, and the fleſhly Appetite, when the End is ſo near. It may likewiſe check the folly of <hi>Ambitious Deſigns:</hi> that Men ſhould make ſo much ado to get into ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, from whence they may ſo eaſily fall. Where being puft up with vain applauſe, they forget themſelves, and their latter end, till their Life, and Glory expire together. Where are now the Great, and Mighty, and Honourable, who have made ſuch a noiſe in the world? What is now the <hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>Duſt</hi> of an <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that of their meaneſt Slaves or Captives? Could their Dignities and earthly Glory preſerve any of them, from the ſtroke of Death, or the Judgment of God, or without Repentance, from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Sentence?</p>
               <p>Think, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> how little it will ſhortly ſignifie, whether I have been known and honoured among Men or no; any farther than God may be glorified by it. How ſhould it ſuppreſs vain Glory? to think of being <hi>one day</hi> eſteemed, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106982:62"/> worſhipt, reverenced, and applauded by dying Men, and laid in the Grave <hi>the next?</hi> Let me rather ſeek that Glory and Honour, to which <hi>Immortality</hi> is annext: and labour to be accepted with God, at whoſe Bar I moſt be judged, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the teſtimony of a good Conſcience; and then it is not much whether I paſs through good Report or evil Report: no contempt, or frowns, or threatnings of Men need then diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me. Tho' I ſhould be trampled on by the foot of Pride, while others are happy in a dream for a little while; and it may be have a proſperous paſſage to damnation; I'le rather thank God for delivering me from their Temptations, and giving me the opportunity, and call, to haſten my Preparations for <hi>a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter World.</hi> Let God diſpoſe of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here, and <hi>Reputation</hi> too, as beſt ſhall pleaſe his Sovereign Will: only be pleaſed to keep me upright, and to preſerve me from everlaſting Shame and Confuſion of Face, after the general Reſurrection, and final Judgment. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me a Portion now in thine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Love, and own me for <hi>Thine</hi> at laſt, in the Great and terrible Day of Reckoning; that then I may hear the

Tho' I know beſides my own Mortality, that to inforce the Argument, there is a principle of <hi>Corruption</hi> in all theſe things; that our very <hi>Manna</hi> here in a little while will ſtink; and <hi>Bread,</hi> which is the ſtaff of Life, moulder; our richeſt <hi>Garments</hi> wax old, and rot; <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> ruſt, and the greateſt <hi>Beauty</hi> wither, and every thing that is <hi>Earthly,</hi> decay and periſh. And ſhall not this teach me to ſit looſe from all ſuch things? Can I imagine, that in my laſt hour it will be <hi>eaſier</hi> to part with <hi>much,</hi> than little? or better in the day of Judgment, to have a great Eſtate to anſwer for than a leſſer one? We read concerning the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> (who rightly underſtood the tranſitory nature
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106982:64"/> of Riches, and his own mutable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) that the only <hi>purchaſe</hi> he made with his Riches, was a <hi>Grave:</hi> chuſing to take Poſſeſſion of the Land promiſed him rather by a mark of his parting with it, than of his poſſeſſing it. Did I think oftner and more ſeriouſly, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> of tarrying here but a little while; I ſhould more eaſily be perſwaded, that a <hi>little</hi> of this World were ſufficient to carry me through it. I ſhould conſider more that my <hi>Heaven-born Soul</hi> is made and deſigned for another, an endleſs World: and therefore ſhould not ſo far <hi>forget his own People,</hi> and <hi>Fathers Houſe;</hi> as eagerly to purſue and ſeek what is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the <hi>Body,</hi> for a little while, and whereof a little with Contentment will be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The ſame Reflection may be uſeful to contract our Thoughts to <hi>preſent Duty;</hi> that we may not perplex our Minds with <hi>long deſigns</hi> and <hi>Projects;</hi> which if we dye this <hi>this</hi> Year, will come to nothing. Our great Buſineſs in this World is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the little portion of Time, which is allowed us. Not that good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for the publick Benefit, may not be begun by one, and finiſht by others: or that we are not obliged prudently to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106982:64"/> for thoſe who ſhall come after us, by attempting many Things of <hi>probable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> to Poſterity.

               <p>And this heightens our Folly, that while we purſue great Projects in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>this</hi> World, and dye without effecting them, our preparations for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> are neglected; and ſo we are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cut off in the midſt of our Folly, and <hi>all our Thoughts periſh.</hi> How eaſily, how ſoon may they do ſo!

               <p>IN this World we begin a Year, and quickly come to the end of it; and ere long the little number of our Years, and Days, will be expired. But when Death conveys us into the World of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the day of <hi>Eternity</hi> ſhall never be cloſed with an Evening. Of how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence is that <hi>Death,</hi> by which an <hi>Eternity</hi> muſt be decided! What atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what ſeriouſneſs, what diligence, what care, doth the diciſion of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a matter call for!

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106982:65"/>
               <p>At the Creation of the World, <hi>Time</hi> got the ſtart of us, and was <hi>five days</hi> elder then we: but our Immortal Souls ſhall endure beyond the utmoſt limits of Time, and laſt as long as the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father of Spirits, of whoſe duration there is no end. Shall I then exiſt and live, though my Body periſh and ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? Shall my Soul, my Self exiſt beyond the Grave, in Felicity or Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that for ever and according to my preſent Actions? What am I then moſt concerned to mind? What am I to chuſe? What am I moſt to fear, to wiſh, to do? What is a ſhadow of Honour and Reputation among dying Men? What are a few drops of fleſhly Pleaſure for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to eternal Rivers of Pleaſure, at God's right hand? What are the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an hour or two, to the pains and anguiſh of Eternity? What can the World, Fleſh, or Devil give me, comparable to eternal Life? What can I ſuffer in the way of Holineſs, that may be ſet in the Balance againſt an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hell? And yet how often, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> how boldly, how unconcernedly, how fooliſhly do I hazard the one, and forfeit the other, for the Sins and Vanities of <hi>this</hi> World! Whereas one proſpect of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106982:66"/> 
                  <hi>Eternity</hi> ſhould make every thing that is <hi>Temporal,</hi> appear little in my Eyes: the higheſt elevation of earthly Greatneſs, abundance of Riches, the great Affairs, Buſineſs, and Imployments of the World, Pomp, and Splendor, and Reputation, and all that now flatters the Senſes, and the vanity of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Oh that I could but live as believing and expecting <hi>an Eternal State!</hi> as having it in my Eye, managing all my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with a viſible reference to it; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to all the World by my Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Deportment, that I do in earneſt believe it certain; for be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo <hi>Certain,</hi> if I do not apprehend, and conſider it as <hi>ſuch,</hi> it will no more affect me than a Fable. Neither is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſider it as <hi>certain,</hi> but as <hi>near:</hi> for the moſt weighty, the moſt terrible things, apprehended as at a great <hi>diſtance,</hi> will little move. Thinking of the long Interval between the advantage of being exempted from ſuch Evils for ſo long a time, will pleaſe me more than ſuch diſtant Calamities will affright.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore endeavour to impreſs the conſideration of <hi>Eternity, as at hand,</hi> more deeply on my Heart, that I may walk, and live, diſcourſe, and pray, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106982:66"/> demean my ſelf in every thing, as <hi>near</hi> an unchangeable State. Am I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that this is certain, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and operations of my Soul, from the reflections of Conſcience, from the Righteouſneſs of God, in his Government of the World, from the preſent unequal diſtributions of Good, and Evil by his Providence, and from the plain and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent aſſertions of his Revealed Will? I have nothing to object, nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but I find a neceſſity of inculcating and urging the conſideration of it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its influence. I find it needful to reflect often, how <hi>near</hi> I am to ſuch an endleſs State: that in <hi>one Inſtant,</hi> by Death, I enter upon it: and that <hi>this</hi> Inſtant may be as near me, as my <hi>next Thought.</hi> That the holy Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the two contrary Conditions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, (and every Man and Woman in the World ſhall ſhare in one of them) as both Everlaſting: the one, by <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, Eternal Glory, an incorruptible Crown, that fadeth not away, an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Inheritance, an Houſe Eternal in the Heavens, &amp;c.</hi> the other, <hi>by unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire, a Priſon whence no eſcape, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation, Everlaſting Burning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Puniſhment, everlaſting Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106982:67"/> a Worm that never dies, wrath that is ever to come, blackneſs of darkneſs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ever,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Think, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> that in one of theſe two contrary States, I muſt abide <hi>for ever;</hi> In endleſs Joy, or Sorrow: Bleſſed in the Preſence of God, or for ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it. And whoever thou art that readeſt this, apply it ſeriouſly to thy ſelf, <hi>'tis thine own caſe.</hi> Yea I tell thee from God, that Holineſs of Heart and Life is abſolutely neceſſary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and that without it thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee his Face, but be puniſhed with Everlaſting Deſtruction from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Glory.</p>
               <p>Is this an unqueſtionable Truth? O let me conſider it, till I feel the Power and Efficacy of ſo important a Principle! let the Impreſſion be deep and laſting! let it pierce and enter into my very Soul! to cool the heats of Luſt, to quench ſenſual and earthly deſires, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all inordinate affections to this World; and fix my reſolutions to mind and ſeek Eternal Life with all my Heart!</p>
               <p>Theſe are not difficult and perplexed <hi>Niceties,</hi> which wiſe and holy Men differ and diſagree about. They are not Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſical Subtleties, which few can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106982:67"/> but the expreſs Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the daily dictates of my own Reaſon and Conſcience, which all Chriſtians, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Men in their Wits, except in an hour of great Temptation, confeſs and own; or whether they will or no, are forced to expect and fear, if they are not in a condition, to conſider them with a joyful Hope.</p>

               <p>The deſcription of that Miſery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inſupportable and Eternal Torments, demands more than a tranſient view: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no words can ſufficiently expreſs the Horror of that State.

                  </note> Sinners in <hi>Hell!</hi> How infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely muſt it exceed the moſt terrible Idea we can now frame of it! to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh out a long Eternity in that Gulph of Darkneſs and Deſpair, under unpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intolerable Torments, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, or hope of End! Miſeries without meaſure! Judgment without Mercy! Pains and Sorrows intenſe, and yet endleſs! without the leaſt ſuccour or relief, relaxation or remedy, diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or change! without a drop of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, without a moments Reſt, without the ſmalleſt beam of Light, or the leaſt glimmering of Hope! Perpetually dying, and never dead! under <hi>unſufferable Wrath,</hi> which yet will be for ever <hi>Wrath to come!</hi> ſeeking Death, and never able to find it, but Eternally to endure all that Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the Conjunction of Death and Life together can render dreadful! What Groans and Cries will theſe Thoughts, and theſe ſufferings wring from their Hearts? But no refuge will then be found, no excuſes admitted, no Prayers, no entreaties will then prevail no Tears move Pity. <hi>He that made them,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106982:71"/> will ſhew them no Mercy, and he that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Never, Never</hi> that is the killing word that breaks the Heart of thoſe hopeleſs Priſoners in the place of Torment. When once deliver'd over to that Priſon of Gods Wrath, they ſhall no longer be priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hope. Judgment ſhall be brought forth unto final victory: and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Soul ſhall ceaſe for ever.</p>
               <p>The vain hopes of Sinners ſhall then be ended in eternal deſperation: Hell will be full of thoſe, who did once <hi>hope</hi> they ſhould never come there, and full of thoſe who <hi>deſpair</hi> of deliverance from thence; but ſhall ſuffer exquiſite Pains that cannot be numbred, or meaſured, or endured, but that every <hi>Minute</hi> of an hour will ſeem an whole Year, and yet muſt <hi>eternally</hi> be endured by miſerable Sinners, who will not be wiſe in time to prevent ſuch an intolerable Portion. Let me therefore, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> deſcend into <hi>Hell</hi> by Meditation whilſt I live, that I may not deſcend thither when I dye, and be ſhut up for ever in that Priſon, the place of endleſs Torment.</p>
               <p>Might we but ſuppoſe, that one of thoſe Miſerable Souls did let fall but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106982:71"/> 
                  <hi>one Tear,</hi> in an <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> years; and if after he had by this means wept ſo much, as that his Tears would equal the <hi>drops</hi> of water in the whole <hi>Sea,</hi> his Miſery ſhould have an <hi>end;</hi> this were <hi>Hope,</hi> this were <hi>Comfort.</hi> But alas! af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Period, his Miſery will be <hi>as far</hi> from an end, as when he <hi>firſt</hi> began to feel it. It will then be but <hi>the Beginning of Sorrows,</hi> which will <hi>never, never, never</hi> End.</p>
               <p>Think, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> that this is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sinners Cup; this is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Sin,</hi> and the certain doom of final Impenitence and Unbelief. 'Tis no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Cheat, or melancholy dream, but the expreſs repeated word of God, and Chriſt, the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and the voice of <hi>Reaſon</hi> too, ſuppoſing but the Immortality of the Soul, and the power of ſelf-Reflection, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sinners muſt needs be <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> as carrying continually an Hell within them; unleſs God work a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to prevent it, which there is no ground to imagine he will, or ſhadow of reaſon why he ſhould. God hath pawn'd his <hi>Truth,</hi> and his<note n="(i)" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Eternity,</hi> to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106982:72"/> execute this Sentence of his threatned wrath. He is a God of infinite <hi>Mercy,</hi> 'tis true; but he hath told us how far his Mercy ſhall extend. He will not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>one Attribute</hi> to the diſhonour and the diſparagement of the reſt. That obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and impenitent Sinners, ſhall thus periſh, is not becauſe the goodneſs and mercy of God are not infinite, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his other Perfections are ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> His Holineſs, Juſtice, Truth, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and Wiſdom. Was it Wiſdom and Goodneſs to annex ſuch a Penalty to the violation of his Law; and can it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with them, to inflict his threatned wrath? Shall we ſuppoſe God to uphold his Dominion and Government by a Falſhood? to keep the World in awe by the menaces of ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſhall no where, never be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted? Is it unlikely, that God ſhould exerciſe ſo much ſeverity? and is it not as improbable, that his repeated Word and Oath ſhould prove falſe? Is it not a righteous thing with God, as the Governour of the World, thus to puniſh the obſtinate Deſpiſers of his Grace? who ſlighted his Authority, diſobeyed his Law, affronted his Soveraignty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided his Power, denied his Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106982:72"/> his Holineſs, and joyned Iſſue with the Devil, to pull him from his Throne; who abuſed his Patience and Long-ſuffering, and ſcorned all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; who thruſt away their own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and would not take warning; who burſt all his bands aſunder, and broke through all obſtructions; and would not be ſtopt in their courſe of Vanity and Folly, or ſo much as conſider their danger; who rejected his calls to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and refuſed his Mercy, when it was offered; and preferred a Luſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his favour, and the Pleaſures and Profits of this World before the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory; and notwithſtanding all the methods of his Grace, and the checks of his Providence, and of their own Conſcience, they will go on, they <hi>will Dye?</hi> Let me, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> adore the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Juſtice</hi> of God in all his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and tremble at the threatnings of that <hi>Eternal Wrath,</hi> which ſo few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider or believe, till 'tis too late. Let the foreſight and the fear of ſuch an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable endleſs Puniſhment, be a means to ſave me from it! Let me herein read the evil of Sin, and learn to abhor and avoid it. Let me pity, and warn, and counſel, and pray for thoſe of my Relations and

                  <hi>O bleſs the Lord, O my Soul!</hi> for any <hi>good hope through Grace,</hi> of eſcaping this Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Endleſs Miſery. <hi>And let all that is within me bleſs his holy Name.</hi> I have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> the ſame endleſs and unſupportable wrath, which Thouſands are now under, and ſhall be under to all Eternity; but he did not ſuffer me to fall into it. To be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of thoſe Torments after many years miſery, would be thought an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,

And hath not God done <hi>more</hi> for me? Am I not <hi>more indebted</hi> to his Goodneſs? He hath kept me out of <hi>Hell,</hi> and offers me the Heavenly Glory upon reaſonable, honourable, and eaſie Terms. Bleſſed be God, I may <hi>yet</hi> eſcape the wrath to come.</p>
               <p>Let me heartily compaſſionate the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe multitudes of <hi>deceived,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Souls, whoſe eyes are blinded by the God of this world; who will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, till they are convinc'd by the light of that Fire which ſhall never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht. Yea, when I read, or hear of Ten or Twenty thouſand men ſlain in a War, (whteher of <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) let me think of it, with other apprehenſions than formerly I was wont to do. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many, it may be, the moſt of theſe ſhall never have any Comfort or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy more; fearing leſt the ſame Sword or Bullet that gave them their mortal wound, hath fixt them under God's <hi>Everlaſting

In very many other caſes, the Faith of <hi>this Article</hi> would rectify my Opinion, and direct my Actions, if ſeriouſly conſidered and improved. This would make me think of <hi>Death</hi> under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion, than 'tis commonly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For without the conſideration of <hi>Hell</hi> annexed to it, it is not ſo very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but that Heathens have been able to deſpiſe it. The moſt contrary Sects among them, on different grounds have been able to do it; but conſider <hi>Death</hi> as a paſſage to Eternal miſery, as the Gate of Hell, as the end of all Comfort to a wicked Man, and the beginning of an endleſs Calamity, and nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more <hi>dreadful</hi> to a Guilty unholy Soul. Some of my <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> it may be, who died this laſt year, are now among thoſe Hopeleſs, Deſpairing Wretches, who expect the final Judgment of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate their inſupportable Miſery. If they were permitted to come, and tell us what they ſuffer, and what they know; what a terrible conſuming Fire God is; what Vanity, Luſt and Folly, brought them to this place of Torment; what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they would adviſe us to, while in a State of Hope, to prevent the like; if
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106982:75"/> we have any love and and kindneſs for our ſelves, any Bowels of Compaſſion to our own Souls; what a Change do we think it would work upon us? But if we will nor <hi>hear</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles,</hi> neither ſhould we believe, tho one came from the Dead.</p>

               <p>There will be no need of <hi>Novelty,</hi> as now, to give a reliſh to our Happineſs. All Happineſs in this World is by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Man's preſent Condition, with his paſt, or with that of ſome Inferiors. But the Intrinſick Good, Felicity, and Joy of Heaven, will need no ſuch <hi>Foil</hi> to ſet it off; no ſuch Compariſon to make it prized. The Bleſſed Spirits will never loſe the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Senſe of that low and miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which they were raiſed to ſo great a Glory; and ſo will ever equally rejoyce in the Happineſs of their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wonderful Change. And what was at <hi>firſt</hi> delightful, will <hi>for ever</hi> be ſo; and not be diſdain'd or leſſen'd by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; as it happens in this World, from the Emptineſs, Shallowneſs, and Vanity of the Creature.

The bleſſed <hi>Object</hi> is abſolutely <hi>Infinite,</hi> and ſo will be always <hi>new</hi> to a finite underſtanding; and

               <p>Let me by ſuch Thoughts quicken and excite my diligent Endeavours, after a greater meetneſs to injoy ſo great a Bliſs. And to that end, conſider whether any of thoſe happy Souls, who have finiſht their Courſe, and obtained the Prize, do now regret their utmoſt Diligence, Patience, and Perſeverance, during their ſhort abode here, to ſecure the Bleſſedneſs of an endleſs Life: <hi>No, no,</hi> they are far from repenting the Time they ſpent, the Trouble they were at, the Care they uſed, the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they met with, the Sufferings they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; to conflict with the World, and the Fleſh, to reſiſt Temptation, to watch over their Hearts, and Words, and Ways, to work out their Salvation, to pleaſe God, and be faithful to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They find to their unſpeakable Comfort, and everlaſting Joy, that <hi>Heaven</hi> makes amends for <hi>all</hi> they could do or ſuffer in order to their coming <hi>thither.</hi> Yea, they find that they were not Diligent, and Humble, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and Circumſpect enough. That they did not love God, and ſeek his Glory, redeem their Time, and improve all their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106982:79"/> Talents and Opportunities of doing and receiving Good, and give up themſelves intirely to prepare for Heaven, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree they ſhould have done. They find by the tranſcendency of the bleſſed Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that it deſerved infinitely <hi>more</hi> than the moſt Active, Zealous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an upon Earth did ever do, in order to it.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire my ſluggiſh, carnal Heart, with holy Light, and Life, and Zeal, and Fervour! that <hi>looking to the things which are not ſeen, which are Eternal:</hi> I may<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.19.</note> 
                  <hi>lay up a good Foundation againſt the Time to come, and ſo lay hold of eternal Life!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>alas!</hi> How much have I neglected the great Duty of Holy <hi>Meditation?</hi> How little skill and experience have I in it? How taſtleſs and inſipid oftentimes are my Thoughts of God! how confuſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady! how little Pleaſure or Advantage have I by contemplating his higheſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies? Yet methinks, could I but retain the ſame awakened, lively thoughts of Heaven, and Eternal Life, which <hi>ſometimes</hi> I have had; might I continually feel the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106982:79"/> ſweet and ſacred Influence, as for a <hi>little ſeaſon</hi> I have ſometimes felt it; how little, how very a <hi>Nothing,</hi> would all <hi>this World</hi> be to me! how comparatively weak, its ſtrongeſt and moſt alluring Snares, to draw me off from God! with what an unſhaken mind could I refuſe and reſiſt 'em! with what an unconcerned <hi>indifference</hi> could I look upon all its moſt charming Glory!</p>
               <p>Could I maintain ſuch a frame of Spirit, as I have ſometimes had for a little while, in the ſerious Contemplation of Divine Myſteries, in Fervent Prayers, and other Solemn Duties of Religion; when the acts of Faith were ſtrong and lively, my Heart ſet on fire with love to God, and holy breathings after him; admiring his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Grace to fallen Sinners, (and to my Soul in particular) when he brought me to the very Suburbs of Heaven, (tho <hi>alas!</hi> how <hi>ſeldom!</hi>) by the delightful Thought of what the Bleſſed Spirits above injoy, in being where Chriſt is, and beholding his Glory; when I was ready to ſay within my ſelf, <hi>'Tis good to be here; this is no other than the Gate of Heaven; Oh, when ſhall Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality be ſwallowed up of Life!</hi> But when I thought at any time to fix and ſettle in ſuch ſweet Contemplations, how quickly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106982:80"/> did my lazy backward Heart fly off! how ſoon did the flame decay and dye away! how ſoon did I find my ſelf fallen down to Earth again! ſunk down from the Boſom of my Lord, preſently forgot my ſelf and Heaven, to dwell among the Pots, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Dunghill! 'Twas not on my own Wings, <hi>O Lord!</hi> that I ſoared ſo high; but I hope by the breathings of that holy Spirit of Light and Love, who bloweth when, and where, and how long he liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Who gave me at any time any ſuch <hi>firſt fruits of the Spirit;</hi> who convinc't me of the Certainty of the Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by a lively believing foreſight of it; who made me earneſtly deſire the Wings of a Dove to be gone, and appear before God in <hi>Sion;</hi> made me Pant and Groan to be delivered, and to be with God and Chriſt, with inexpreſſible Deſire and Joy, unconceivably mixt with Sighs and Groans. <hi>O my God!</hi> let not this experience be only ſuch a <hi>Taſte</hi> of the Powers of the World to come, as is conſiſtent with <hi>final Apoſtacy!</hi> only the ſeeming Zeal of the ſtony Ground! the rapturous Joy of an Hypocrite! from the Power of Imagination, and a heated Fancy; from the workings of meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Self-love; upon miſtaken apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and a falſe Opinion of Heaven;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106982:80"/> but by the holy effects, let me be aſſured of the Cauſe and Principle; that it was of God!</p>
               <p>Teach me from the ſweetneſs of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Communion with God <hi>now</hi> in any of his appointed Ordinances, to argue to my ſelf what that moſt raviſhing Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will be, that the Enjoyment of God in Heaven will afford the Soul. Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is now imperfect, to what it ſhall be: and therefore our Conſolation, Peace and Joy, is but in part, and incomparably leſs than we are aſſured it will be, when we ſhall be admitted to behold the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord. 'Tis now at moſt, but as the Break of Day, to the Luſtre of the Meridian Sun. But if in this low imperfect State, we can ſometimes obtain ſo near a View of his Glory, and feel ſuch ſweet Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Grace; how much more of this Conſolation and Joy is reſerved to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If in this Pilgrim State, the Gifts and Graces, and Comforts of the Holy Spirit are ſo refreſhing: O! what hath God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared beyond the Grave, for thoſe who love him? If now he ſometimes ſhed abroad his love in our Heart, after ſuch a manner; how much better ſhall I love him, and feel the influence, and evidence of his Love to me, when I ſhall be with him, and ſee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106982:81"/> him Face to Face? If the apprehenſions of this future. Bleſſedneſs, do now encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, raiſe, and animate my drooping Soul: O, what ſhall I know and ſee? And how ſhall I rejoyce, when the Vail is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved? If a Sacramental Communion with God and Jeſus Chriſt, be ſometimes ſo ſweet, and ſo affecting; what will the Bleſſed Communion with God, and all his Saints <hi>above</hi> amount to! when I ſhall ſit down with all the Children of God, in the Preſence of the Bridegroom, at the laſt great Supper of the Lamb in Glory! If the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of our Inheritance be ſo reviving, what will be the full Poſſeſſion of it? If the Hopes of that glorious Day, by holy Meditation, be ſo tranſporting; what will be the end of our Faith and Hope? If a Grape or two in the Wilderneſs, be ſuch a Cordial; what will be the whole Vintage in the Land of Promiſe?</p>
               <p>Shall I after all this, forget my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and run from God and Heaven, to imbrace or ſeek a periſhing Toy? Shall I hide my ſelf with <hi>Saul,</hi> among the Stuff and Lumber of this World, when God is calling me to a <hi>Glorious Crown?</hi> Art thou, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> a King's Son, an Heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an expectant of ſuch great Felicity, and yet ſtoop ſo low? Hope for Heaven,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106982:81"/> and yet graſp this Earth, and hug the vain Appearances of earthly Good? Hope to be <hi>like to God;</hi> (and oh how Glorious an Hope is that!) to partake of his Image, and live Eternally with him; and yet be ſollicitous, anxious, and diſquieted about Honour and Money, and a Temporal Intereſt? And mightily concerned about the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany Gratifications of the Fleſh, and the Injoyments of this World? Art thou a Pilgrim and Stranger here, and travelling home to the Heavenly Country, and yet eager and paſſionate about earthly Things? Should an Heart that is ſet upon Heaven, (or may be ſo, and ought to be ſo) ſhould it burn with ſuch <hi>Kitchin,</hi> ſuch common <hi>Fire?</hi> And neglect the unconceivable Riches and Pleaſures, and immortal Honours of the other Life, and the dawnings of that Glory upon my Soul, by the foretaſts of it in this? How great is the diſproportion between the Heavens and the Earth? How vaſt the Circumference of the one, and how ſmall a Point the other? How many thouſand Miles doth the Sun travel in the Heavens, while it paſſeth but one Inch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Dial? Oh that my Affections were carried to <hi>heavenly</hi> Things, with a ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſomewhat anſwerable to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Object. And let their motion to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106982:82"/> 
                  <hi>earthly</hi> Things be rather ſlow and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, like that of the Sun on a Dial. Since I profeſs to believe, and wait for the heavenly Glory, ſhould I not live, as ſeeking ſuch things, as expecting ſuch a Glory? And are careleſs and indifferent Thoughts, ſleepy heartleſs Prayers, faint and weak Endeavours, becoming in ſuch a caſe? Shall I not mend my Pace, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my Diligence in my preparatory Work? When I can believingly foreſee the bleſſed Recompence; waiting for that <hi>Everlaſting Light</hi> of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, which no Eclipſe ſhall ever darken or obſcure; for that Eternal Glorious Day, which ſhall never be cloſed with an Evening. When I ſhall ſee the Face of God in Chriſt, and be like him, participate more of his Image, reſt in his Love, and dwell for ever in the Light of his Countenance, according to the Prayer and Promiſe of my Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>And ought not ſuch a proſpect to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Bitterneſs of all our intermediate Sufferings? We are now oftentimes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs and Sorrow; but Eternity will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for an interrupted Joy. When we ſhall exchange all our Troubles for everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſt, our Priſons for perfect Liberty, our Poverty for the Riches of God; Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               </head>
               <p>WHat is there in Heaven or in Earth, <hi>O Lord!</hi> but thy Preſence to be valued, loved, deſired, choſen, ſought, or delighted in? There is nothing in either World deſirable <hi>without Thee,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly <hi>above Thee,</hi> nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon <hi>with Thee.</hi> In <hi>Thee</hi> alone I truſt; on <hi>Thee</hi> I depend; in <hi>Thee</hi> I repoſe my Confidence and Hope; from <hi>Thee</hi> I expect all my Felicity and Salvation. What ever I can loſe, yet with the continuance of <hi>thy Favour,</hi> which is my Life, I have ſtill <hi>Enough.</hi> With that I am <hi>Rich,</hi> without it I am <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Miſerable.</hi> And if I want the Love of God, all that Heaven and Earth can give beſides, will not make me Happy. In <hi>Thee,</hi> therefore, I would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all my Affections, all my Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! There is nothing of <hi>Heaven</hi> to be had on <hi>Earth,</hi> but in thy Favour, Image and Love, and the reviving Senſe of it. And all the <hi>Heaven</hi> I expect <hi>hereafter,</hi> 'tis in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106982:83"/> more full and immediate Communications of theſe in thy bleſſed Preſence. I can <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> nothing upon <hi>Earth;</hi> I can <hi>injoy</hi> nothing in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Thee!</hi> both here and there, thou <hi>art,</hi> and <hi>ſhalt ever be</hi> my all-ſufficient ſatisfactory Portion, <hi>my Everlaſting All!</hi> None elſe can be the <hi>Portion of my Soul.</hi> Nothing elſe can fill up all its Wants, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all its Cravings, be ſuited to all its Capacities, appeaſe and charm all its reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Motions, and give complacence to all its Deſires, and be the proper Object of all its <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is there elſe can juſtly claim my <hi>Love,</hi> or pretend to my ſupreme Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in compariſon with <hi>God?</hi> Thou art alone the proper Center of it. Thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and incomparable Excellencies, (who art <hi>Love it ſelf</hi>) deſerve my choiceſt Love; and thy numberleſs Mercies and Benefits, challenge it as a juſt Debt; as a piece of Homage due from all, and of ſpecial Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude alſo from me. Oh that I could love thee <hi>above all things!</hi> who alone art worthy of all my Love! O that <hi>Divine Love</hi> might be the ruling Principle within me! to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire all my Thoughts, to regulate all my deſires, to ſet all the Powers of my Soul on Work! O that it might take the full Poſſeſſion of my Heart, and ſo animate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106982:84"/> and order all my Actions to pleaſe him, whom my Soul loveth! If as yet I cannot ſay with thine Apoſtle, <hi>Lord! thou that knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I Love thee.</hi> Yet I can ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I would Love thee!</hi> Thou haſt provided for our Happineſs, by that firſt and great Command of loving thee with all our Hearts, and Souls, and Strength. But alas! how backward is my ſluggiſh carnal Heart, to this delightful Exerciſe? Tho I have ſo oft been told, that <hi>God is Love,</hi> and that <hi>he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> O ſhed abroad thy Love into my Soul! that I may feel the vital Power and Influence of it, and live continually in the <hi>Love</hi> of God, and that nothing may ever be able to ſeparate me from it.</p>
               <p>Whom have I in Heaven or Earth, <hi>to Hope in,</hi> but <hi>Thee?</hi> I expect more from Creatures, than they can or will perform; but God can do for me more abundantly than I can ask or think; exceed my lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thoughts, out-ſtrip my higheſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. And no man was ever diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who made <hi>Thee</hi> his <hi>Hope.</hi> When I meet with Croſſes, and Wrongs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, Contempt, Hatred, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution from Men, I need not wonder; I was never told by God, it would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106982:84"/> here. Did I look for leſs from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and expect more from God; Did I reckon this World to be a ſtate of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and not a place of Reſt and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; My Faith and my Deſires would be ſtronger with reſpect to God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and temporal Calamities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments leſs afflictive and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>And what is there, <hi>O Lord!</hi> in Heaven, or in Earth, my Soul can <hi>deſire</hi> beſides <hi>Thee?</hi> Is there any thing deſirable, but as it is thine, of thee, and from thee? And bears ſome Impreſſion of thine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or brings ſome Intimation of thy Love? And what can I reaſonably deſire; what that is worth deſiring, or having, but thou art able to <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>give?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In whom, or what, ſhall I <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> but in <hi>Thee,</hi> O Lord! ſhall I ſolace my ſelf in tranſitory Goods, that ſlip between my Fingers, and periſh in the Uſing? or reliſh carnal Joys, which pollute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe the Soul? When I may and ought to <hi>Rejoyce in Thee</hi> at all Times, as the only Source of perfect Everlaſting Joy. Let me then ſtir up my drooping, deſponding, unbelieving Heart, to rejoyce in God; who takes Pleaſure in the chearful Service

Can I ſay and believe, that God is the Portion of my Soul; that <hi>he is my God,</hi> and I hope to live with him <hi>for ever,</hi> and not <hi>Rejoyce?</hi> Or can I conſider the Grace of the new Covenant, the matchleſs Love of Chriſt, and the precious Promiſes of the Goſpel, and not ſee reaſon to <hi>Rejoyce?</hi> Yea, doth my Soul love God, and endeavour to pleaſe him; and is not the very Act and Exerciſe of holy Love, mixt with unſpeakable ſweetneſs?</p>

               <p>Is there any other, in whom I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my <hi>Truſt,</hi> but in <hi>Thee,</hi> O Lord! the Rock of Ages? The might of thy Power,

And they who know thy name will do ſo: for <hi>in the Lord Jehovah is Everlaſting Kindneſs and Strength.</hi> To anſwer all my doubts, to ſupply all my wants, to fill all my deſires. May not God take it unkindly, that I truſt him no more? And is it not a criminal unkindneſs that I give him not the glory of all theſe Excellent Attributes, which are the grounds of Truſt; by a conſtant, ſteady, intire dependance on him for all that I need?</p>
               <p>I have none in Heaven but <hi>Thee,</hi> O Lord! as the object of my <hi>Invocation and Worſhip.</hi> Let other Chriſtians have recourſe to <hi>new Mediators,</hi> and call upon other Gods: I will make mention of <hi>thy Name,</hi> and of thy Righteouſneſs <hi>only.</hi> And ask of thee whatſoever I need, for the ſake of <hi>thy Chriſt,</hi> my <hi>only</hi> adorable <hi>Mediator.</hi> Him thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

That Glory, thou wilt not give unto another.

               <p>WHen our Bleſſed Saviour ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to judge the world, I read that it ſhall be, <hi>in his own Glory, the Glory of his Father, and of the Holy Angels.</hi> If by the <hi>glory of his Father,</hi> be meant that of the Divinity, as the Original and Author of all things in nature, as the Almighty Creator of the World; and by the <hi>Glory of his holy Angels,</hi> be underſtood that of the Legal adminiſtration, the <hi>Law</hi> being given by the diſpoſition of Angels; and by <hi>his own Glory,</hi> that of the Goſpel, as he is the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> that in the Glory of all theſe, he ſhall come to Judgment: we have a ſummary account of the <hi>three different Revelations</hi> which God hath made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to mankind; by the Light of <hi>Nature;</hi> that of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the more manifeſt one of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> According to which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106982:88"/> 
                  <hi>every man</hi> is to be judged at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Tho we cannot diſtinctly tell what or how great our Lord's <hi>Glory</hi> will then be; we may be certain, it will be ſuitable to the dignity of his Royal perſon; ſuitable to the grandeur of his Father's Majeſty; with the ſplendor of a <hi>Triumphant Prince,</hi> who is <hi>Heir of all Things,</hi> and hath all power in Heaven and in Earth committed to him; the Great Lord of both Worlds, Head of Angels and Men: and ſuitable to his glorious office, as Mediator, and the appointed Judge of Quick and Dead.</p>
               <p>If at his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> his Face ſhone, and his Rayment was white and glittering, How much more ſplendid will his laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be? When the <hi>Bodies</hi> of his Saints ſhall be ſeven times brighter than the luſtre of the <hi>Sun?</hi> And if his Members ſhall then be ſo glorious, how tranſcendantly more <hi>ſo</hi> will their Head, their <hi>Lord</hi> appear? If the delivery and promulgation of the <hi>Law,</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was accompanied with ſuch circumſtances of terrible Majeſty, how much more may we ſuppoſe the <hi>Great Aſſize</hi> will be attended with? When he comes to judge for the violation of the Law, and the contempt of the Goſpel. And if even <hi>Moſes</hi> did then exceedingly quake and fear, what will be the conſternation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106982:88"/> and trembling of the wicked World at the Coming of Chriſt? <hi>When he ſhall be revealed from Heaven, in flaming Fire,</hi> with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retinue of his mighty <hi>Angels,</hi> as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bright Stars about the more glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs. The lights of Heaven ſhall be Eclips'd; the viſible Sun ſhall vail its bluſhing head as infinitely out-ſhone: the preſent glory of the Creation be all benighted, by reaſon of his tranſcendant Brightneſs. Yea, the Heavens ſhall be wrapt up as a ſcroll; the Elements melt away with a mighty noiſe: the Earth and all its works be burnt up; and the whole Univerſe as one great Bonefire, to adorn the <hi>Triumph</hi> of our Lord's Appearance. And this uſhered in by the voice of an <hi>Archangel,</hi> proclaiming his approach: and the voice of God ſupplying the uſe of a Trumpet, to raiſe the Dead, and poſſeſs mankind with an aweful Reverence of their Judge.</p>
               <p>Thus in Triumph, as a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and a <hi>Judge,</hi> ſhall he come again, who once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the form of a Servant to be judged and condemn'd by Man. <hi>Then</hi> he was called <hi>King</hi> in ſcorn: <hi>now</hi> he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as much above all Earthly and Humane Greatneſs, as once he ſtoopt for our ſakes beneath it. <hi>Then</hi> the Contempt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106982:89"/> and no way eſteem'd Deſirable, when he came from the womb of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Mother: <hi>now</hi> the Terror of the World, when he comes again from the right hand of his Father. No more to be ſubject to a ſtate of Meanneſs, but <hi>to render vengeance to all, who know not God, and obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and to be glorified in his Saints, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in, and by all them that believe</hi>

               <p>He was put to <hi>ſhame</hi> in the days of his Fleſh, made himſelf of no Reputation, and accounted unworthy to live; but when he comes again, he will put on a Garment of Vengeance, to repay Fury to the Enemies of his Croſs, and make his wicked Deſpiſers riſe again to ſhame, and everlaſting Contempt. They that once bowed the knee to him in <hi>mockery,</hi> and ſhaked their heads at him in <hi>deriſion,</hi> ſhall then <hi>ſee every knee bow before him, of things in Heaven, things in Earth, and under the Earth;</hi> Angels, Men, and Devils in ſubjection to him as Lord and King. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> who condemn'd him as his Priſoner, ſhall appear before him as his rightful Judge; and know, that he was another-gueſs King and Monarch than the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor. The <hi>falſe-witneſſes,</hi> who accuſed

They that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Condemnation to Death, as a Criminal, ſhall be ſentenced from his mouth, as their Judge, to Everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They that ſcourged him, as a Malefactor, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. They that made him ſtagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of his Croſs, ſhall ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guilt and Puniſhment of deſpiſing it. They that Nailed him to the accurſed Tree, between Thieves and Robbers, ſhall be ſentenc'd to endleſs Puniſhment in much worſe Company. They who gave
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106982:90"/> him Gall and Vinegar to drink, ſhall not be able to get a drop of water to cool their own Tongues.

               <p>If the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall have a ſorer Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than Ignorant <hi>Heathens,</hi> who never heard of Chriſt, never ſaw his Miracles, or were inform'd of his Doctrine; How ſhall we eſcape? For he will come again as <hi>a Conqueror,</hi> and <hi>a Judge,</hi> and not as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer and a ſurety, as he came at firſt; and tho he was numbred with Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and made his Grave with the Wicked, at his firſt Appearance; he ſhall hereafter be attended with the ſhouts of Angels who excel in ſtrength, and the joyful Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Saints, glittering as the Light, and paying Homage to him as the Judge of Quick and Dead. He, whom we have deſpiſed, ſhall then be encompaſt with a dazling Glory that will confound us. He, whom we have affronted, will be clothed with a Majeſty that ſhall aſtoniſh us. He, whom we have offended, ſhall be armed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106982:90"/> with Power, and with Wrath to puniſh us; and all that continue to lift up the Heel againſt him, ſhall then be made his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool: all that refuſe to kiſs the Scepter of his Grace, ſhall be broken in pieces by his Iron Rod.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture doth frequently and expreſly aſſure us, that he will <hi>thus</hi> come again, and for theſe ends. He is exalted, and gone to Heaven, <hi>as the Head of his Church,</hi> and the King of Glory; and when he foretold his Aſcenſion, he gave a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Return.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106982:96"/> and bloody Sweat were for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and by his Stripes we are Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He bowed his Head on the Croſs, that we might lift up ours in Triumph; and becauſe we had eaten of the forbidden Fruit, he hung on the accurſed Tree. 'Twas <hi>for us</hi> that he ſuffered the Frowns of Heaven, the Enmity of Hell, the Rage of Devils, the Hatred and Perſecution of the World: He was judged, that we might not come into Condemnation: He was Crucified, that we might be Glorified; and he is now <hi>Come again</hi> finally and fully to effect it.</p>
               <p>O the <hi>Height,</hi> and <hi>Depth,</hi> and <hi>Length,</hi> and <hi>Breadth</hi> of the <hi>Love of Chriſt,</hi> which paſſeth Knowledg, but calls for Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and everlaſting Gratitude! This is the <hi>Bleſſed Day,</hi> we long'd and waited, and prayed for! This is our <hi>Gracious,</hi> our <hi>Glorious Lord,</hi> whoſe Love melted our Heart, whoſe Promiſe was our Support, whoſe Word was our Rule, whoſe Spirit was our Comforter, whoſe Croſs was our Crown, and the hope of his Appearance our chief Conſolation!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord!</hi> what <hi>am I,</hi> what <hi>was I,</hi> that the ever Bleſſed Son of God ſhould do and ſuffer, and purchaſe all this <hi>for me?</hi> I can remember when I was ignorant of God, a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106982:96"/> Stranger to him, at Enmity with him, under the Power of Darkneſs, and the Devil, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures, haſtening to Hell, and liable to his Wrath. But he choſe me out of the World, ſtampt his Image upon me, pardoned my Sins, and imbrac't me in the Arms of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love. <hi>O happy Change!</hi> and yet how little did I prize his Grace, admire his Love, and expreſs my own, or promote his Glory, and honour him in the Eyes of others? How did I diſhonour my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and holy Calling, as his Diſciple, by aggravated Apoſtacy? But he recovered me by <hi>Repentance,</hi> and healed my <hi>Back-ſlidings,</hi> and received me graciouſly, becauſe he loved me freely. <hi>O admirable Grace!</hi> to pardon, and ſave, and bring to Glory ſuch an unthankful <hi>Wretch,</hi> as I have been! to make ſuch a <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Others,</hi> whom I knew on Earth! that the ſame Power, which makes <hi>them Miſerable,</hi> now makes <hi>me Bleſſed!</hi> that when they are baniſht from his Preſence into Everlaſting Deſtruction, I am admitted to behold his Glory, and ſhall dwell with him for ever!</p>
               <p>O, how much <hi>more</hi> do I now ſee and find, than ever I believed, of the Love of Chriſt, and his promiſed Salvation! How
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106982:97"/> much <hi>more</hi> glorious is the Perſon of my Redeemer! How much <hi>more</hi> Excellent is the heavenly State, than ever I thought or expected! I could not have imagined the <hi>thouſandth thouſandth Part</hi> of that which I now ſee and feel. I cannot but admire, and ſpend an <hi>Eternity</hi> in admiring, and praiſing the incomparable Grace and Glory of my bleſſed Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Such holy Admiration will certainly produce the moſt <hi>thankful Adorations</hi> of our Lord Jeſus. Saying one to another, <hi>O Bleſs the Lord of Love and Glory!</hi> who humbled himſelf ſo low, as our Mediator, and hath exalted us ſo high, as the bleſſed Fruit of it! How can we ever <hi>enough</hi> adore and praiſe him, who condeſcended ſo far, and hath done and ſuffer'd ſo much for us? See how the holy Angels worſhip this King of Glory! and have not every one of us more reaſon to do ſo? O let all the Quire of Heaven celebrate his glorious Love! and let us his Redeemed, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ones ſay continually, <hi>Let the Lord be magnified; who hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood, and made us Kings and Prieſts unto God his Father, and through him ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O merciful Saviour! O glorious Change! <hi>O happy Society!</hi> with whom we ſhall Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106982:97"/> adore our Common Lord. We can ſome of us remember when we lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Earth, how we wept and prayed, and faſted and mourned together, how we ſuffered, and complain'd, and ſin'd together. O the marvellous Change our Redeemer hath now wrought for us, and in us! Theſe Bodies, theſe Souls, this Life, this Place, this Company, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, are not like thoſe in yonder World. But <hi>alas,</hi> who can deſcribe what Believers ſhall then think and ſay to extol their Saviour! How ſmall a Portion is it we underſtand of that World? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can I conceive, and how much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs? Bleſſed be God we know ſo much, as the matter of our joyful Hopes; and for ever Bleſſed be God, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and provided ſuch a Glory for us, as cannot now be fully known.</p>
               <p>What inexpreſſible Sweetneſs might Believers taſt by rejoycing in <hi>Hope,</hi> did a more lively <hi>Faith</hi> realize all this to their Souls? We might liſten as it were to the Shouts and Acclamations of the <hi>Saints</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. We might behold them about the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, with Palms of <hi>Victory</hi> in their Hands, a Crown of <hi>Glory</hi> on their Heads, and Songs of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106982:98"/> 
                  <hi>Triumph</hi> in their Mouths, ſaying, <hi>Allelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah;</hi>

                  <hi>Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy Pleaſure they are, and were created.

               <p>Whence is it, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> if indeed, I believe and expect all this; that I can Hear, and Read, and Think, and Speak of <hi>theſe great Things,</hi> with no more ardent Affections, ſuitable Preparations, inportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayers, and vigorous Deſires? How ſhould the believing Thoughts of that Day promote my heavenly Mindedneſs, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, Contempt of the World, Patience and Perſeverance?

               <p>I Am haſtening every Year, every Day, to the period of this Life: I muſt <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> appear before my Glorious Judg; and experience theſe Terrors or Comforts, this Bleſſedneſs or Miſery, which I have now read of. Shall I not therefore inquire, which of the two belongs to me? Is it not worth conſidering, whither I muſt go, and how I ſhall fare, when I quit this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? What is like to be my next Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? To which of the two unchangeable States I ſhall be adjudg'd? Shall an Inquiry of ſo much conſequence be put off, to an indefinite hereafter? Do I not deſire to know the worſt, while a remedy may be found? Or am I content to dye, through
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106982:99"/> an unwillingneſs to diſcover that I am Sick? The queſtion to be reſolved, is of infinite weight. Shall I not ſpend a few hours to know what will become of me <hi>for ever?</hi> An error is more than poſſible, 'tis eaſy to miſtake; and the hazard of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo is unſpeakably great. How many thouſands periſh eternally, even under the Light of the Goſpel, who never ſuſpected their Danger? How ordinary, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a thing is it, for Men to be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived! how ſucceſsful is the Devil in this ſtratagem againſt the Souls of Men! Is it not then a moſt criminal ſtupidity, to be contentedly ignorant, and unreſolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am reconciled to God or no; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am led by the Fleſh or the Spirit; whether I am in the broad or narrow way, which lead to ſuch contrary ends; that is, whether, if I die in this condition, I ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> or <hi>periſh?</hi> Can ſuch an <hi>enquiry</hi> be <hi>frivolous</hi> or <hi>indifferent?</hi> Is the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it ſo <hi>contemptible,</hi> or <hi>my concern</hi> in it ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> that it merits not to be attentively conſidered? Shall I never ask my Soul, till I am leaving this World, (the <hi>unfitteſt time</hi> of all to begin ſo important an Affair) <hi>what am I? to whom do I belong? whoſe Image do I bear? how have I lived, and what do I do? what do I love moſt? what do I moſt conſtantly deſire, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106982:99"/> chooſe, and ſeek? how doth the Pulſe of my Soul beat? is it quickeſt towards</hi> God, <hi>or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> World? <hi>whither am I going? what will be the final upſhot and iſſue of my preſent courſe? is it</hi> Heaven <hi>or</hi> Hell <hi>I muſt be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by dying? what ſecurity have I got for</hi> Eternal Life? <hi>what proviſions have I made? what foundation have I laid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſtrangely infatuated are moſt men, who talk of an <hi>Everlaſting Life</hi> as an Article of their Creed, and ſay they count upon it that they muſt dwell in <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> for <hi>ever;</hi> and ſeldom or never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves in good earneſt, and for any time, with a ſetled compoſed exerciſe of thoughts, which of theſe <hi>Two</hi> is like to be their Lot. Or if they begin to ſearch and try themſelves, they come to no <hi>Concluſion,</hi> or conclude too haſtily; they pluck off the Plaiſter as ſoon as it begins to ſmart; they are either frighted with the horrid proſpect of paſt Crimes, or, having eſcap'd the groſſer Pollutions of the World, judge too favourably of their own eaſe. They commonly do the work but by halves, and ſo go from the Glaſs, and forget what manner of perſons they were.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> ſequeſter my ſelf from the World, to commune with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106982:100"/> my own heart, to reflect upon my paſt life, and look into my preſent ſtate, to recollect and review the moſt conſiderable paſſages of my courſe and time hitherto. O how neglected and diſuſed a Practice is this, which doth challenge and require our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt ſerious Concerns about it! And how many begin it, and are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and leave off without reaching the end of ſuch an Enquiry!</p>
               <p>How much <hi>wiſer</hi> in this reſpect are the <hi>Children of this World, in their Generation,</hi> than the <hi>Children of Light?</hi> Who is ſo exact in his <hi>Accompts</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and his own <hi>Soul,</hi> as <hi>Trades-men</hi> in their <hi>Dealings</hi> with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? Who is at the pains to write down his <hi>Sins</hi> and his <hi>Mercies?</hi> the <hi>grounds</hi> of his <hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>encouragements</hi> of his <hi>Hope?</hi> or keeps a <hi>Journal</hi> and <hi>Diary</hi> of his <hi>Spiritual State?</hi> Who doth at ſet times, once a <hi>Month,</hi> or once a <hi>Quarter,</hi> or even once a <hi>Year,</hi> take a juſt view of Himſelf, his Heart, and Life, and State, as a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> that he may ſee what he hath received and done, what he owes, and what he may expect; that he may know whether he <hi>thrive</hi> or <hi>decay;</hi> whether he <hi>increaſe</hi> or <hi>decreaſe;</hi> whether he go <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>forward;</hi> wherher he be <hi>Richer</hi> or <hi>Poorer</hi> this year than the laſt? And is it not a <hi>ſymptom</hi> that you are <hi>declining,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:106982:100"/> when you love not to examine your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts? Is there not ground of <hi>jealouſie</hi> and <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> that you are <hi>behind hand,</hi> becauſe you are loath to inquire, whether you are or no? and unwilling to know the worſt of your Condition? Nevertheleſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and bringing the matter to a <hi>Determination,</hi> at what uncertainties muſt we live? and how unconceivable an hazard do all Hypocrites and unrenewed Sinners run? And how reaſonable, how neceſſary is it that we ſhould know, and in order to it, prove our ſelves? We muſt therefore beſtow Time and ſerious Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence about it, that we may examine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the bottom, and come to ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; ſo that we may form a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning our own caſe.</p>
               <p>He that would do it to good purpoſe, muſt endeavour to underſtand clearly the terms of the <hi>Covenant</hi> on God's part, and on ours: and take care not to Judge of himſelf by miſtaken rules; by a falſe Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, that God will not juſtifie; or by any ſuch characters as will not conclude. But moſt men are <hi>unwilling</hi> to bring themſelves to a <hi>Trial,</hi> or to let Conſcience deal plainly and faithfully with them. They are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly ſecure, and ſee not the neceſſity of this duty. Or do not ſuſpect themſelves.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106982:101"/> They preſume they need not be at that Trouble: or are ſo taken up with the World, that they cannot find <hi>time</hi> and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for it. And many men dare not bring their Hearts and Ways to a Trial. There is commonly ſome <hi>ſecret Luſt</hi> indulg'd, which they are loath to let go. But moſt go on in ſin, and periſh Eternally, becauſe they think there is no danger of periſhing: and never Repent, and make their Peace with God, becauſe they fancy and preſume 'tis done already.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me beg of thee, <hi>whoever thou art,</hi> who readeſt this, to put the caſe to thy ſelf, ſeriouſly to admit the doubt, whether you are not miſtaken; make the <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> that you have not hitherto ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conſidered the State of your Soul. You are confident that <hi>all is well;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are unwilling to examine farther: but for that very reaſon you ought to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether it be ſo or not? Do but ask your ſelves ſeriouſly, what is the <hi>ground</hi> of your good Opinion concerning your ſelf? For what reaſon can you thus conclude?</p>
               <p>Did you ever ſeriouſly lay to heart the <hi>Characters,</hi> and Deſcription, which the Scriptures give, of thoſe whom Chriſt will own at the laſt day; and of ſuch whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106982:101"/> he will reject and reprobate? With un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned application to your own caſe, have you therewith prov'd your ſelves? and come to a ſetled Judgment, after a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enquiry? And was the <hi>Concluſion</hi> to your Comfort and Joy? If ſo, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence hath it ſince had upon your Heart and Life? Hath it promoted Purity, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Heavenly-mindedneſs, Contempt of this World, and ſtronger Deſires after the Image, Love, and Preſence of God, and the Glory of Chriſt? Moreover, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Is not this a good while a-go? How have you behav'd your ſelf ever ſince? Have you not reaſon to look back with ſhame? If you but <hi>ſlightly</hi> examin'd your ſelf formerly, reſolve to do it more effectually now: Review the ſins you have been ſince guilty of. And if you have not done any thing conſiderable of this kind, you ought <hi>now</hi> to begin. It is ſeaſonable to begin the year by ſuch an Exerciſe, and it will be found of great uſe, in all the following parts of it: eſpecially when you come to examine your ſelf afreſh, in order to the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> For we ought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to renew the ſad remembrance of our former Sins; that from time to time we may renew our <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106982:102"/> work of our Life, and not of one day. And he that comes to the Sacrament, and will look no farther back, than to the laſt Communion, may poſſibly preſume too much, that all was then as it ſhould be, and not be humble enough.</p>
               <p>If any one therefore reſolve in good earneſt upon an holy Life, and ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to prepare for <hi>Eternity,</hi> as it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make a general review of his Life, ſo I deſire to afford him the beſt Counſel I can, in order to it.</p>
               <p>It may be adviſable,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. <hi>Baxter's Saints Reſt.</hi> p. 3. chap. 7, 8, 9.</note> if you have not formerly begun this work, to imploy one hour at leaſt in a Day, for ſeveral Days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in <hi>writing down</hi> the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſages of your Life you can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, deſiring God's Aſſiſtance therein; and keeping your Eye upon your End, in the whole; that is, thinking ſeriouſly that 'tis in order to <hi>Eternity,</hi> that you now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelf.

                  <hi>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my Reins, and my Heart, for thy Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is before mine Eyes, and I will walk in thy Truth. Thou haſt ſearched me, O Lord, and known me; thou knoweſt my Thoughts a far off; all my ſecret Sins are in the Light of thy Countenance; and thou art acquainted
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106982:104"/> with all my ways; ſet my Sins in order before me, that I may Repent, and forſake them. Show me mine Infirmities and Weakneſſes, that I may watch againſt them. And teach me to Judge and Condemn my ſelf, that I may not be judged of the Lord, or condemned with the World.</hi>

                  <hi>XXV.</hi> How Chriſtians ought to examine their <hi>Decays</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> The greatneſs of their <hi>Sin,</hi> and of their <hi>Loſs</hi> under ſuch a Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: God's <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> and departure from them, conſidered, to awaken Endeavours of a Recovery. In what manner the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Adherence</hi> may be acted by one, who hath no <hi>Aſſurance.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT cannot but be of uſe to <hi>Believers</hi> alſo, at ſtated Times to examine themſelves, concerning their Languiſhings and Decays in Grace, falling from their firſt Love, to a Spirit of Indifferency and Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſorderly walking or unfruitfulneſs; whether <hi>gray Hairs are not here and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they know it not.</hi> For God may withdraw by degrees, ſo that his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may not preſently be perceiv'd. And ſome kind of Activity in Duty may be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106982:105"/> continued upon falſe Principles, and from Common Aſſiſtance, while a Chriſtian, as to his ſpiritual State, may be under a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſumption. 'Tis not difficult for others to obſerve it ſome times, and would be viſible enough to themſelves, would they ſpare a few hours to examine the matter. The Puniſhment of ſuch Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, the loſs of the quickning and comforting Preſence of the Holy Spirit, deſerves likewiſe to be inquir'd into, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a ſpeedy Remedy, and ſhould enforce the Counſel.</p>
               <p>I mean not barely the Ebbing of <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> in the Duties of Religion, or the want of Life, and quickning from <hi>ſenſible Conſolations,</hi> which new Converts, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as have been reclaim'd from a courſe of notorious Impiety) have more of at firſt than afterwards. This <hi>doubting Chriſtians</hi> ſhould particularly take notice of, by the Inſtance of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> who was extraordinarily feaſted at his firſt return, but was doubtleſs contented afterwards with the ordinary Proviſions of his Fathers houſe. Neither doth God diſpence the ſame meaſure to <hi>all alike,</hi> nor to <hi>any</hi> alike at <hi>all Times:</hi> Some, who are called to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Services and Sufferings, than others, or had greater Conflicts before Converſion,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106982:105"/> may have a greater ſhare than the reſt of their Brethren. Neither will the <hi>ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Grace imparted to <hi>ſome</hi> Perſons, ſo diſcernably move and comfort, as it will do ſome others of a different Temper. 'Tis not therefore ſo much to be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Enquiry, (if at all it need to be ſo) whether we have more or leſs of ſenſible Joy in the performance of Duty. But</p>
               <p>Whether we are not fallen and declin'd, <hi>as to the inward vital Acts of Grace, and in the outward Fruits of Holineſs.</hi> Whether we have ſuch clear convincing Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Divine and Spiritual Truths, and the Myſteries of the Goſpel, as formerly; whether our minds are not become more vain and heedleſs; whether our Knowledg of God, and of the Revelations of his Will, be as powerful and efficacious upon our Hearts and Lives, as heretofore; whether there be no leſs Frequency, leſs Conſiſtency, leſs inward Satisfaction in holy ſerious Thoughts, than formerly. You were wont to pray and endeavour, that God might be <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> in your Thoughts every day, and by frequent Ejaculations in civil Affairs, to maintain a dayly converſe with God; but now you mind not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or not; yea, you cannot but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106982:106"/> know, that it is not <hi>thus</hi> with you ſtill. It was once your Burden to be peſter'd with fooliſh, filthy, worldly, vain Thoughts, eſpecially on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> or in the Worſhip of God; you rejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd them, you lamented and pray'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; do ſo much as examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be thus ſtill.</p>
               <p>Conſider all your <hi>Affections,</hi> and their ſeveral Objects; and ſee whether a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Lukewarmneſs hath not diffus'd it ſelf into every of them. Examine eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Grace;</hi> and ſee whether your Faith, Hope, Love, holy Deſires, and Delight in God be not miſerably abated; as to the ſtrength and vigor, the efficacy, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſe of every of them; ſo that your Thoughts of God are few, cold, and lifeleſs, without deſire, delight and love.</p>
               <p>Conſider the <hi>Opportunities of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and ſolemn Occaſions of approaching the <hi>Divine Preſence:</hi> Are they as much the deſire of your Souls, and the rejoycing of your Hearts as once they were? Are you not more eaſily diverted from them, leſs ſatisfi'd and refreſht by them? Are not all Goſpel Ordinances leſs powerful and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and your profit and advantage thereby unſpeakably leſs then formerly?
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106982:106"/> Do you hunger and thirſt, and pant as the Hart after the Water-brooks, to draw nigh to God, and come into his Courts? Do you make Conſcience of preparing before hand? Do you come with a real deſire, and deſign, and expectation of profiting, and bettering your Spirits? Do you joyn in every part of Divine worſhip, with that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſeriouſneſs, and compoſure of mind, and taſte the ſweetneſs and benefit of ſuch ſolemnities, as <hi>formerly?</hi> Are ſuch ſervices performed with that Awe of God, with that Humility, Fervency, and Intenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, as ſometimes they were? Are you not more negligent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd before and after, whether you find any thing of this or no? Tho your Deſires are weak, your Hearts flat, your Thoughts wandring, your Spirits trifling, ſo the work be done, and the duty be over, (in how formal, cuſtomary, and careleſs a manner, ſoever it be) you conſider it not, you lay it not to Heart, you reflect not upon it, you bewail it not, or at leaſt are better contented and ſooner quieted, and take leſs notice of the frame of your Heart in ſuch Duties, than formerly?</p>
               <p>Examine farther, how 'tis with you as to the great <hi>diſtinguiſhing Duties</hi> of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Chriſtian, (if performed as they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106982:107"/> ought to be) I mean <hi>Secret Prayer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation:</hi> Are you as ſtrict and careful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Conſcientious, frequent and abundant in theſe, as formerly? May not our Cloſets and places of Retirement wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt us? How ſeldome are we there? How quickly are we gone? How eaſily diverted? How ſoon tired? How do we trifle in that work, and ſhuffle it over, and take up with the ſhadow and image of Prayer? Our former humble and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayers, joyful Thankſgivings, and ſweet Contemplation of the Myſteries of Religion, compared with our preſent dayly practice, will teſtifie that we are declin'd and fallen.</p>
               <p>Moreover conſider <hi>the Evil of Sin,</hi> and how your Heart ſtands affected to it. Is not your Hatred of Sin, and Zeal againſt it, much decayed? eſpecially with reſpect to inward <hi>Spiritual ſins,</hi> ſuch as the ſecret workings of unbelief, and diſtruſt, pride, envy, uncharitableneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you bewail it, ſtrive againſt it, and ſhun the occaſions, and fear the temptations that may lead you into Sin, as once you did? Have you not loſt much of that tenderneſs, and holy Jealouſy over your heart and ways, you formerly had? Do you not now make more bold with Temptation? Are you not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106982:107"/> oftner conquered? and with leſs Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance? and by ſmaller Temptations? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you not more <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſerviceable?</hi> Root and Fruit in a withering condition? God leſs Honour'd, and others leſs profited, and edified by your Example and Life? Do you not adhere more to the world? conform to it, and comply with it in many things, which formerly you durſt not have done? and are every day waxing worſe? Make a pauſe a while, and bethink your ſelf, what this will come to at laſt? When even the little Good that remains, is ready to dye.</p>
               <p>May I not ask <hi>ſuch Chriſtians,</hi> or deſire them to ask themſelves; What is already the effect and conſequence of this Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Is not God's Spirit removed, and the Light of his Countenance Eclipſed? Yea as to many of them, are they not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſad apprehenſions of God's diſpleaſure? Do they not feel the terrors of the Lord? Do they not walk heavily from day to day? They that could once converſe with <hi>God</hi> on all occaſions as a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>Father,</hi> do now think of God and are troubled: Thick Darkneſs doth incompaſs them round about: They have loſt the ſenſe of his Love, the comforts of his preſence, and their Song in the night, and ſee no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106982:108"/> This is a more hopeful caſe however, than <hi>theirs,</hi> who are under great Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings and Deſertion, and hardly ſenſible of it. To awaken and aſſiſt both; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I beſeech you, <hi>whence you are fallen,</hi> and what you have loſt, and what will be the iſſue of this; if Sickneſs, or ſome ſmart Affliction overtake you; or if you ſhould dye in this condition. And inquire <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> and preſently, into the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all this Evil: for a few tranſient thoughts will not affect the Heart and perſuade to Action. And do it <hi>preſently,</hi> becauſe by every delay your work will be the harder, your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the greater, and your recovery the more difficult. Reflect upon the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> as well as <hi>Affliction</hi> of this caſe. Know that you have diſpleaſed God, and run from him, neglected his Preſence, and griev'd his Spirit, and in what Inſtances you have done ſo; that hath made him weary of his dwelling? what Ordinances you have ſlighted; what Duties you have omitted; what ſins you have given way to; in order to <hi>Repentance</hi> and deep Humiliation.</p>
               <p>Can you <hi>contentedly</hi> ſit ſtill, with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal State of things? while <hi>God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> (yea a great deal indeed) <hi>againſt you, for having left your firſt Love?</hi> Will you not endeavour to remove that, which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106982:108"/> hath made ſuch a ſeparation between God and you, and brought you thus low? What Communion with God, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of his Grace, what Influences of his Spirit, and Evidences of his Favour have you loſt? And will you not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg your Iniquity, and abaſe your ſelves in the Duſt, and return to the Lord, and do your firſt works? that he may heal your Backſlidings, and receive you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly; that you may again take hold of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and be at <hi>Peace</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>But to be <hi>at Peace</hi> with God, is not the whole of your Concern, you need not only a Pardon, but a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to heal you; as doth a Malefactor, that is not only liable to the Law, but deſperately ſick. Your State is <hi>ſinful,</hi> and dangerous, as well as troubleſome. From performing duties in ſuch a manner as you now do, you may quickly be Tempted to let them altogether alone. God may be ſo far provok'd to ſuffer Satan to make attempts upon you of that kind: (and he is forward enough to make uſe of ſuch an opportunity, to try all his Snares and Stratagems againſt you:) till he prevail with you, to think hardly of God himſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. <hi>Gilpin of Temptation.</hi> p. 2. chap. 6.</note> unthankfully to overlook
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106982:109"/> all his former kindneſſes, to put the worſt Interpretation that can be upon all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; to diſtruſt and quarrel with him, as if his faithfulneſs had failed, and his Mercy were clean gone for ever, and there were no hope left, for one in your caſe: and ſo run into <hi>Deſperation,</hi> and through the ſubtlety and violence of Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, try the moſt fooliſh and unlawful means for eaſe and cure; either open Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, or it may be Self-Murder.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſpeedy preſent <hi>Repentance</hi> is neceſſary, to find out, and mortifie <hi>every Corruption,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> eſpecially, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells us, you have moſt indulg'd; from whence your Diſtreſs doth principally ariſe: Confeſſing your ſin freely, fully, and without reſerve, and waiting on God in the diligent uſe of all means, for the recovery of that which you have loſt: and Juſtifying God in his Righteouſneſs, Truth, Wiſdom, Holineſs, in all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes. That you may regain a Spirit of Prayer, and taſte the ſweetneſs, vertue, and efficacy of every Duty, and of every Ordinance; and God may give you <hi>the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſs, and the Joy of the Lord may be your Strength,</hi> for future ſervice and ſuffering.</p>

               <p>In the mean time, do not caſt away your <hi>Hope,</hi> but tho you have (too juſtly) depriv'd your ſelf of the <hi>Faith of Aſſurance,</hi> yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to maintain and exerciſe the <hi>Faith of Adherence</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106982:113"/> good have I let ſlip? Have I not made it more my buſineſs to <hi>ſeem</hi> Religious, than really to <hi>be</hi> ſo? How much of the Patience of God have I abus'd? refuſing his calls to Repentance, reſiſting the ſtrivings of his Spirit, ſmothering my Convictions, and turning the Grace of God into wantonneſs? Inſtead of returning gratitude for all his Love, I have repeated my Tranſgreſſions after Forgiveneſs: and gone in <hi>a circle</hi> of Repenting and Sinning, even to this day. <hi>Lord,</hi> I am aſham'd, and lay my ſelf in the duſt before thee. To me belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion of Face. If God ſhould condemn and puniſh me as a Rebel, and a Traytor, and give me the Portion of Hypocrites, I cannot but own his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> even in Hell I muſt do it, with my flaming Tongue and Breath.</p>
               <p>O Spare me for thy mercies ſake! <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified: if Thou lay Judgment to the Line, and Equity to the Plummet.</hi> Give me <hi>Repentance unto life, never to be repented of,</hi> never to be retracted again. Bring me to the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which cleanſeth from <hi>all ſin.</hi> Behold the ſighings of a contrite Spirit: For <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my Tranſgreſſions unto thee, againſt whom I have ſinned: O Lord, forgive the Iniquity of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106982:113"/> my Sin.</hi> I am unworthy to lift up my Hands and Eyes towards Heaven, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy Son, or thy Servant: I am vile in mine own eyes, becauſe I have made my ſelf vile in thine. For this I am troubled, and mourn, and my Soul is grieved within me.</p>
               <p>O thou <hi>Heavenly Phyſician</hi> of Souls! from thy <hi>Pity</hi> alone I expect my cure. I am miſerable and undone without thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and expect no relief but from the Treaſure of thy Grace. I muſt periſh, and ſink under the burden of Sin, if thy merciful hand do not ſave me, and lift me up. I am intangled and inſnar'd by the Devil and my Luſts, and without thy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour can never hope to get free. <hi>O Lord forgive my Sin, and heal my Soul: Deliver and ſave me for thy Mercies ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May I not yet <hi>hope in thy Mercy?</hi> Thou haſt mercifully born with me hitherto: thou calleſt me to repent; thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt me to return, and promiſeſt to forgive thoſe Sins which are confeſſed and forſaken: O do not caſt me out of thy Sight and Preſence, now I deſire from the bottom of my Heart to return to thee! <hi>I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> for my paſt Iniquities. But <hi>alas!</hi> ſuch is the hardneſs of my Impenitent Heart, that I am even
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106982:114"/> aſham'd of my humbleſt Repentance: how much more may God deſpiſe and reject it? But haſt thou not given thy Bleſſed Son to dye for Sinners? and exalted him to this very end, to be <hi>a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins?</hi> And by the word of thy Grace, thou beſeecheſt all, (even the Greateſt Sinners) to accept of mercy; and art <hi>more willing</hi> to pardon, than we can be to Repent. 'Tis thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Glory, agreeable to thy Nature, and declared Name, <hi>as a God gracious, and merciful, ſlow to Anger; and of great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin.</hi> O Pardon mine <hi>Iniquity</hi> for it is <hi>great;</hi> and receive <hi>an humble Penitent,</hi> who implores thy Grace, according to the Tenor of thy <hi>new Covenant,</hi> flying to the arms of thy Mercy, through the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord, hear my <hi>Prayer,</hi> and let not the mixture of my weakneſſes and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs turn it into Sin: but graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look upon <hi>a returning Prodigal;</hi> and cauſe me to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that my ſorrowful Heart may be comforted, and my life be directed to thy Praiſe. Lead me into the path of life, that I may no longer err from the way of thy
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106982:114"/> Commandments: Teach me to do thy Will, O God, and write thy Law upon my Heart, that I may never more <hi>return to Folly.</hi> I am convinc't of the Evil of Sin, of thy Right to govern me, of the Equity and Juſtice of thy Law, of the ſweetneſs and rewards of keeping thy precepts: O ſanctifie my Heart, and make me <hi>Sound in thy Statutes,</hi> that I may hate every falſe way, and be devoted to thy Fear, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Life.</p>
               <p>If there be any <hi>particular Luſt,</hi> or Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which through the power of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the deceitfulneſs of Sin you have fallen into; that hath waſted Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and rob'd you of your Peace, and provok't God to write <hi>bitter things</hi> againſt you; be ſure to humble your ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay in an eſpecial manner for <hi>that</hi> Backſliding: Confeſs it freely, with its aggravations. Conſider whether it was not after ſome ſpecial manifeſtation of God's Love, after ſome ſpecial warning, ſome ſtrong Conviction, under or ſoon after ſome great Affliction from God, or ſome more than ordinary kindneſs of his Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And impreſs ſuch Thoughts, to humble your ſelf the lower, ſearch into the grounds and cauſes of ſuch Apoſtacy, ſuch as the abatement of your
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106982:115"/> Watchfulneſs, the neglect of ſerious cloſet Devotion, making bold with Temptation, too great compliance with vain Company, venturing too far in lawful or indifferent Things, toò much Confidence in your own Wiſdom, Strength, and ſtedfaſtneſs, not fearing ſufficiently the Approaches and Beginnings of Sin, or avoiding the fuel, incentives, and occaſions of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate and diſguiſe nothing, that may make your ſin exceeding ſinful, <hi>leſt</hi> by ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Art of the Devil, you deceive your ſelf by an half-Repentance; and the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> you think to be caſt out, return again with <hi>ſeven</hi> worſe than himſelf, and ſo your latter end be worſe than your Beginning. For if the ſin be not truly hated, but only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over with penitential Aſhes, it will quickly flame out again, when it meets with combuſtible matter, and a ſtrong blaſt of Temptation.</p>
               <p>But if you are griev'd to the very Heart, and abhor the Sin, and reſolve to quit it, you need not doubt of God's readineſs to receive you to Mercy. His Spirit is yet ſtriving with you, if you are willing to Repent, and return to God. He ſought you, and call'd you to return, when you were wandring as a loſt ſheep in the broad way; and can you think, he will not be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106982:115"/> found of you, if you ſeek him with your whole Heart? Therefore <hi>renew</hi> your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and beg more earneſtly a Spirit of Humility, Holy Fear, and Watchfulneſs: And every morning implore Divine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours againſt that Sin, and all <hi>Temptations</hi> to it. (<hi>Which,</hi> as much as poſſible, you muſt avoid.) Conſtant and fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> after Repentance, muſt be your refuge, and your Remedy. If you let fall your hands, this <hi>Amalek</hi> will prevail again: As ſoon and as far as you fail in the conſtancy, and fervency of <hi>that Duty,</hi> your Sin will get ſtrength, and ſucceſsfully attempt you another Time. But by this practiſe, God may turn Evil to work for Good, make you gain by your loſs, ſtand the faſter by your Falls, and become ſtronger by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery of your weakneſs, and ſo be better eſtabliſht for the future.</p>
               <p>But take heed that you pervert not the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, and encourage your ſelf to ſin again by the <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> that if you ſhould <hi>Fall,</hi> 'tis but to <hi>Repent,</hi> and renew your <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and all will be well. This is a ſubtle Artifice of Satan, but ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, as ſhould take with none, who have ever known by <hi>Experience,</hi> what it is to <hi>Repent.</hi> Who have felt the burden of Sin to be heavier than <hi>a Millſtone;</hi> than
<note place="bottom">Luke 23. c. 30. 17. c. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:106982:116"/> the weight of <hi>a Mountain.</hi> Who have taſted, <hi>how evil and bitter a thing it is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God.</hi> Who have loathed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd themſelves, with deep Remorſe, and Sorrow, and Anguiſh of Spirit: wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all their Hearts, that they had not ſinn'd; and if it were in their power would give all the world to retrieve it; and would rather dye than commit that Folly <hi>again,</hi> they then repented of. Let thoſe who have not <hi>their own</hi> Experience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, read over (and conſider the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> when he wrote) the Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Pſalms. How many like him have roar'd and cried out under the ſenſe of ſin, of ſtings and furies in their Conſcience, of the poiſon'd Arrows in their Souls, and his Terrors ſurrounding them whereever they went: from the ſenſe of ſins Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the apprehenſions of God's Anger, and the conſequent Fears of his Wrath. <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Repentance</hi> after great Tranſgreſſions is <hi>another Thing</hi> than moſt imagine it. When their aggravated Sins ſhall beſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and before, be placed in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and ſet in array againſt them. 'Tis always a work of <hi>Difficulty</hi> as well as Importance, to crucifie corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to tear a beloved Luſt from the Heart, with ſelf-indignation to abhor and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106982:116"/> caſt away what before you lov'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in. How did <hi>David's Sin</hi> ſtare him in the Face? <hi>it is continually with me, it is ever before me,</hi> ſaith He. It haunted him like a Spectre, or like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing on the wall, it ſtill appear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in ſome horrid ſhape.</p>
               <p>However <hi>Sin</hi> may ſmile in its firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and beſpeak us in flattering lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and promiſe Pleaſure, and Profit, and great Advantages and Satisfaction; theſe are but fair Appearances; This is but the <hi>outſide</hi> of the Cup, and the colour of the Liquor: it will prove Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and a mixture of deadly Poiſon, if ever God ſet it home upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and awaken us to a true ſenſe of it. And the Continuance of <hi>dayly Repentance</hi> for Sin, which all Chriſtians are called to, is no ſuch eaſy matter neither. Conſtant ſelf-abaſement and Humiliation before God, from a ſenſe of his Majeſty and Holineſs, and of our many Sins, and pollution thereby: The imperfection of our beſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties continually to be bewailed; inordinate affections to be ſtill mortified; always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and oppoſing Sin, in its Root and and Branches; conflicting againſt the whole Intereſt of the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil; ſeeking after more Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106982:117"/> to be deriv'd unto us by the Grace of Chriſt, to be wrought in us by his Spirit, and maintain'd by his Power; and making dayly applications to the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of all Grace, for ſpiritual ſtrength, to continue our warfare againſt Sin, in all Inſtances of outward duty, and inward Actings of Grace, even as long as we live; all this is included in it. Due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> as ſo comprehenſive and difficult a Duty, would teach us to beware of <hi>Sin.</hi>

               <p>But how often, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> have I mock'd God, and deceiv'd my ſelf, with formal and faint Purpoſes of Amendment? My good Reſolutions have been all of them <hi>as the morning Cloud, and the early Dew, which quickly paſſed away.</hi> One freſh aſſault of Temptation hath ſwept away all my good Purpoſes as a Spider's Web.

               <p>Eſpecially, let me watch againſt my <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> Sins, ſuch as I am moſt inclined to, and where a Temptation doth moſt eaſily enter; where the Devil can take the faſteſt hold, and be leaſt ſuſpected; where he hath <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi> ſprung a Mine, and made a Breach: I have known ſome humble watchful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after being recovered from their Backſlidings, who abhorr'd every Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to <hi>that ſin,</hi> by which they had been defiled and wounded: they can hardly put up a Prayer, but they mention it; hardly have their hearts affected in any ordinance, but they are inwardly aſham'd of it; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear of any one guilty of the like, but they are ready to burſt out into Tears.</p>

Let me live no longer as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my ſelf, but by <hi>Self-reflexion</hi> dwell more at home, reckoning my principal Work to be within doors, to keep my own Vineyard.

               <p>By the neglect of this, Spiritual Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers will inſenſibly creep upon us.

               <p>ALL this, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> which I have now reſolv'd on, is no more than what I am obliged to, by my Vow in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; to renounce the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the Luſts thereof, the World, and conformity to it, that I may Love and Serve the Lord: agreeable to the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right which God hath in me by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Redemption, and his inuumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Benefits. But <hi>the outword waſhing of Baptiſm,</hi> and a viſible profeſſion of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>will not ſave me, without the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God;</hi> 1 Pet. cap. 3. v. 21. May I not by the conſideration of my Baptiſmal Covenant ſuppoſe God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Conſcience, to this effect? <q rend="inline">Will you take <hi>me</hi> for your whole Portion and Felicity? and my Law for the conſtant Rule of your obedience? and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, to your lives end? Will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

               </p>
               <p>I have often renewed <hi>this Covenant</hi> on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions; but did I ever duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the tenor and obligation of it? How have I lyed unto the God of Truth? dealt deceitfully with him? and been Falſe and Fickle, Treacherous and Unfaithful to what I promiſed? O let me now again repeat it, and give up my ſelf once more to be the Lord's, more unfeignedly, more firmly than ever I have hitherto done! that the Bonds of God upon me may be ſtrengthned, and my Soul more throughly ingag'd to be the Lord's. O help me to do it with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs, as the moſt important Affair of my whole Life! by thine aid and Grace <hi>alone</hi> ſhall I be ſincere and cordial in this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and Dedication of my ſelf.

               <p>O moſt Bleſſed and Glorious TRINITY! Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Thy favor is my Life, and thy Lovingkindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Life: Thy Will ſhould have been my Rule, thy Word my Law, thy Glory my end, to pleaſe thee my principal Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to injoy thy Love and Preſence my ultimate Felicity. But I am one of thy <hi>revolted Creatures,</hi> who have loſt thine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and rebell'd againſt thy Law, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Authority, and rejected thy Grace, and deſerve to be caſt out of thy ſight, and baniſht from thy Preſence for ever. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, <hi>O moſt merciful God, and Father,</hi> upon thy gracious invitation and call, I now return to thee my rightful Lord: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thee, as my Almighty, Wiſe, and bountiful Creator, my abſolute Owner, my Righteous Governour, my End, my Happineſs and Chief Good. I <hi>now</hi> accept thine offer'd Mercy; I <hi>now</hi> ſubmit to the Scepter of thy Grace; and give up my ſelf to Thee, as my King, and my God; to rule and ſanctify me now, and be my Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Portion.

I yield my ſelf to Thee, <hi>O my Lord!</hi> Accept and poſſeſs that which is thine own. I lay my ſelf at thy Foot, at all Times, and in all Conditions, to be at thy diſpoſe, and in every thing to acquieſce in thy Good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Deliberately reſolving, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and free conſent of my Will, to walk before Thee in Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all the days of my Life. Hereby I conſecrate and devote my ſelf to be thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Avowed Servant: <hi>Lord, I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, the Son of thine Handmaid.</hi> Though other Lords have had dominion over me, I will now make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Name, and of thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>only,</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> my All-ſufficient Saviour! Thy dying Love, infinite Condeſcention, and matchleſs Grace hath at laſt overcome me, and conſtrain'd me to reſolve to be wholly <hi>Thine,</hi> who haſt redeem'd and bought me with thy moſt precious Blood.

I adore thy merciful Condeſcention, that yet thou wilt receive me on ſuch eaſy Terms. O thou Lord of Life and Glory, now accept of an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy helpleſs Sinner, who flies to Thee as his only Refuge and Hope! who is convinc't, that <hi>None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt</hi> can make his Peace with God, and ſave from wrath to come. I acknowledg thy Title to me, and my obedience, and to all I have, by dying for me. I deſire to take thy Yoke upon me, for it is Eaſie; and thy Burthen, which is Light. I deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and for ever thine, <hi>in an Everlaſting Covenant, never to be broken:</hi> to take up the Croſs, and follow thee, whitherſoever thou ſhalt lead me; through the ſtraight Gate, and the <hi>narrow</hi> way. I will reſerve no Luſt, refuſe no Labour, grudge at no Suffering, ſtick at no difficulty, ſo I may pleaſe, and honour thee, and continue in thy Love.

I adore Thee, <hi>O moſt Bleſſed Spirit,</hi> as proceeding, and ſent from the Father and the Son, to renew all the Powers of my Soul, and reſtore the Divine Image there; to enlighten my mind, to know and receive the Truth, <hi>as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and purify my Heart: and to ſanctify all the Members of my Body, and make them Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto Holineſs, which before were Servants unto Sin; and gradually to deliver me from the power, the defilement, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of Sin; as from the Guilt and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by the Blood of Jeſus. And as the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of God to the Truth of the Holy Scriptures; and as the Great <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete,</hi> to comfort and eſtabliſh the Hearts of Believers, ſealing them up to the day of Redemption, and giving them the Earneſt of the Heavenly Inheritance. <hi>O bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

               <p>But fearing and diſtruſting my ſelf, I give up my ſelf entirely to the conduct of <hi>thy Grace,</hi> depending upon it for my eſtabliſhment and perſeverance. O form my Heart into an obediential Frame! that in every thing I may endeavor to anſwer the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Obligations</hi> of this Devoted State.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>One God</hi> I have once again dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and reſign'd my ſelf; to ſerve, and pleaſe, and honour Thee, in Thought, Word, and Act, to the laſt moment of my Life: in the Performance of all <hi>Duties,</hi> even thoſe which I have been moſt averſe from; in the mortification of every <hi>Luſt,</hi> and the forſaking of every <hi>Sin,</hi> even thoſe which I was once moſt addicted to: Reſolving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately to allow my ſelf in nothing, great or little, ſecret or open, which I ſhall know or believe to be contrary to thy holy Will; making it my buſineſs to be fruitful in good Works, to the praiſe of my Redeemer;

               <p>I call Heaven and Earth, <hi>O Lord,</hi> to witneſs this day, That I own and avow this to be my <hi>Mind,</hi> and the <hi>ſetled Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purpoſe</hi> of my Soul.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106982:125"/> to violate the <hi>Faith,</hi> which I have now plighted in the preſence of God; but to continue <hi>ſtedfaſt, unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Should I undertake any new Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or enter into any new Condition, or change the place of my Abode, where I might ſee more of God's diſhonour, and meet with more and ſtronger Temptations to Sin, and be called to the performance of more difficult duties, greater watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſelf-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would hope hereby to ingage the preſence of God with me, and his Bleſſing on all my Affairs, (on which depends the ſucceſs of all that I undertake:) and would hope the better to preſerve my Integrity, not only <hi>This Year,</hi> but in all the remaining portion of my Time, by the abiding ſenſe of my <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; thus ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
               <p>This is the method I have been often advis'd to, for <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> under doubts and ſcruples concerning my ſpiritual State: to put the matter out of doubt, by <hi>again</hi> accepting the offered mercy and Grace of the Goſpel; and heartily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the new Covenant: giving up my ſelf to God in Chriſt, to be ruled and ſaved by him.

I can ſerve no better Maſter; O let mine Ears be bored to the door of thine houſe, as the Token and Aſſurance of my being thy Servant unto Death.

               <p>Having thus ſurrendred my ſelf to God, what is there, <hi>O my Soul!</hi> that is ever like to prevail with me to go back, and revolt from him? Is the gratification of a <hi>Luſt,</hi>

Shall I ever cancel this Engagement? violate this my Vow? and falſifie ſo many repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Promiſes and Reſolutions? Oh that his Power may reſt upon me! and his Grace work in me both to will and to do! <hi>that this God may be my God for ever, and my Guide unto Death.</hi> Let me never reaſſume this Gift, and Surrender of my ſelf, or defraud God of his Right and Propriety. <hi>His I am, and Him I will ſerve:</hi> living wholly to Him; uſing all I have for him: being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106982:128"/> willing he ſhould <hi>do what he liſt with his own,</hi> and conſequently diſpoſe of me, and of all that any way belongs to me, <hi>as ſhall ſeem Good in his Eyes.</hi> I am <hi>Thine,</hi> O Lord ſave me. Command me my work, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point me my Duty, direct my Station, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Condition. Let me be Thine, tho imployed in the meaneſt ſervice, and the moſt laborious ſelf-denying work. Tho I ſhould be but <hi>a Doorkeeper in thine Houſe, an Hewer of Wood, or a Drawer of water;</hi> Tho I muſt pinch the fleſh, and ſwim againſt the Tide, and renounce what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I valued: yet <hi>This God ſhall be my God for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this means when I come to Dye, (if God ſhould add more years to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle number I have paſt, beſides this I have now begun) I may be able to ſay with Upright <hi>Hezekiah, Remember Lord, how I have walked before Thee in mine Integrity.</hi> That in the face of Death, and the Grave, in the view of another World, and the near proſpect of Eternity, I may be able to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Hope, and Say, <hi>Lord Jeſus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Spirit.</hi> Thou art my Saviour, and I have waited for thy Salvation. I have ſought Thee with my whole Heart; I have choſen thy Favour rather than World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grandeur and Proſperity; I have prized
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106982:129"/> thy <hi>Love,</hi> and endeavour'd to obey Thee, (as the beſt Expreſſion of my own) tho with many Imperfections, which I bewail; I have delighted more in thy Service and Preſence, than in the Pleaſures of Sin and vanity; thy Teſtimonies have been the Joy of my Heart; I took no delight in the Company of the ungodly, after I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Thee; O let me not have my Portion with them in the other World! Fortifie me now againſt the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſtrengthen me in this my laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, enable me to triumph over Death by the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>(my victorious Redeemer)</hi> and carry me through the dark valley, at the divorce of Soul and Body; and grant me an abundant entrance into thine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom; Let me be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy Choſen, and my Body wait in Hope, 'till the general Reſurrection, that I may then ſee thy Glory, and dwell with Thee for ever.</p>
               <p>I gave up my ſelf to Thee, and do not Repent my Choice; acknowledg me now for <hi>Thine,</hi> and do not loſe that which is thy own. <hi>Lord Jeſus!</hi> Thou haſt paid my Ranſom, to deliver me from <hi>Satan,</hi> and from Eternal Wrath, oh do not now reject me, and caſt me off. Is it not thine Office and Covenant to ſave thoſe that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106982:129"/> Truſt in thee? Oh remembr thy Word unto thy Servant, wherein thou haſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to Hope, when I ventur'd my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on thy Promiſe, and truſted to thy Gracious Word for Eternal Life. Thy Love hath already overcome the greateſt impediments of my Salvation. 'Tis as eaſie now to receive me, as to Love me. Thou haſt prepared Glory for thy Redeemed ones; and haſt bid me believingly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee, and wait for thy Salvation. Thou haſt begotten me to a lively hope, by the Incorruptible Seed of the Word; Let me not now be depriv'd of the Inheritance. Can that Love that pitied me in my Blood, and fetcht me from the Gates of Hell, now ſuffer me to fall into it? Oh Crown thy Grace, and perfect thy Preparatory Mercy, with Everlaſting Mercy.</p>
               <p>By voluntary <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Choice,</hi> thou art <hi>my God;</hi> and thy Preſence in Heaven, my ultimate Felicity; I have truſted to thy Gracious Promiſe, to prepare me for it, and bring me to it; <hi>O fulfil thy Word unto thy Servant, wherein thou haſt cauſed me to hope;</hi> and mercifully receive my departing Soul, that ſeeks Thee, that loves Thee, that breathes after Thee, and deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to know Thee better, and love Thee more, and be more entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106982:130"/> to thine Image, and live always in thy Bleſſed Preſence. Thou haſt called me out of the World, plac'd thine Image upon me, enabled me to make it my Buſineſs, though with many Imperfections, to ſerve, and pleaſe, and honour Thee; Oh Receive me to the fulneſs of thy Love and Grace, and preſent me faultleſs before the Preſence of thy Glory, with exceeding Joy. <hi>Amen, Holy Father, be it unto me according to thy Word; through the Merits and Interceſſion of my Alſufficient Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and True Witneſs, in whom all thy Promiſes are Yea, and Amen.</hi>

               <p>HOW precious and delightful are the Thoughts of thy Benefits? <hi>O Lord, how great is the ſum of them?</hi> Should I count them, they are more in number than the Stars. Shall I not obſerve and conſider them? maintain a grateful ſenſe of them, and publickly acknowledg them on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions? that I may <hi>Bleſs the Lord at all
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106982:130"/> Times, and his Praiſe be continually in my mouth.</hi> More eſpecially ſhould I <hi>conclude</hi> and <hi>begin the Year,</hi> with ſolemn Praiſes to my Great Benefactor and Preſerver. I ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and cloſe <hi>every Day</hi> with it, thereby <hi>to make the outgoings of the Morning and the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rejoice in God.</hi> Every Year, every Day, every Hour, every Moment offers me an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to praiſe Him: becauſe he is every minute gracious: and hath been ſo ever ſince he gave me my Being.</p>
               <p>Almoſt one half of my Time hath been ſpent in <hi>Sleep,</hi> when I <hi>remember</hi> not God, nor my ſelf; yet doth He, who never ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or ſleeps, remember me in Mercy, and watch over me for good. Yea, though in the other half, by Day, I have <hi>forgotten</hi> him in a worſe ſenſe, by caſting off his Fear, and not remembring that his Holy Eye is upon me, yet hath he not forgotten to be Gracious. Therefore <hi>I will praiſe the name of God with a Song, and will magnify him with Thanksgiving, and never forget his benefits.

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:106982:131"/> Servants, have been remov'd by Death: and given me farther Time and Space to Repent, when multitudes have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in their Impenitence. Yea, <hi>it was He,</hi> who formed me in the Womb, and brought me ſafely into the World, by whoſe Providence I have hitherto been ſupplied: <hi>in Him I live, and move, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exiſt;</hi> To his undeſerved Goodneſs I am beholding for all the Good of any kind, which I ever enjoy'd: To his Bounty I am indebted for all that I now have; and muſt depend upon it, for whatever I can hereafter expect.</p>
               <p>Through Infancy and Childhood he was pleas'd to preſerve me; favouring me with many advantages in my <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> providing for me a Competent Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood; diſpoſing the Circumſtances of my <hi>Condition,</hi> Relations, Places of Abode, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more advantageouſly than he hath done for Thouſands: affording me many Helps, for the Improvement of my mind, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Knowledg: and preventing my Neceſſities, and even my Deſires, with numberleſs Bleſſings, which I never ſo much as askt for. He hath cauſed ſeveral of my <hi>Relations</hi> to yield me Comfort, when they might have been ſore Afflictions. He hath raiſed up <hi>Strangers</hi> to befriend me, and

               <p>How often hath he <hi>deliver'd my Soul from Death, mine Eyes from Tears, and my Feet from falling,</hi> by ſeaſonable Preſervations? ſo that I do yet <hi>walk before him in the Land of the Living.</hi> He hath reſcu'd me from the brink of many a <hi>Precipice,</hi> which, through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Inadvertency, I did not apprehend or Fear. When I knew not which way to turn, he hath made my Path plain. Under ſinking <hi>Diſappointments</hi> he hath commanded Succor; and been <hi>a preſent Help in the time of Trouble.</hi> In Great Perplexities, his Eye hath been my <hi>Guide,</hi> and his own Arm hath brought Salvation: it may be by the Miniſtry of his <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> obeying his order, and giving unuſual Intimations of very great, and otherwiſe unſuſpected Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: or ſending Relief and Deliverance, by ſuch ſmall, unlikely, and unexpected Means, as carried the name of <hi>God</hi> viſibly ingraven on them.

               <p>And beſides the ordinary and Continued Bounty of every Day, in the midſt of how many <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Dangers</hi> have I felt the dear obligations of his Preſerving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? abroad and at home; in Foreign Countries, as well as my own; in the

               <p>He hath prolonged my <hi>Health,</hi> or made my Bed in <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> He hath often granted the <hi>Deſires</hi> of my Heart when ever it was for his Glory; and contradicted my <hi>Wiſhes,</hi> and diſappointed my Endeavours, in other Inſtances, when it was more to my Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

Many experienc'd Chriſtians have been wont to <hi>write down</hi> ſuch remarkable Appearances of God for them, with the particular Circumſtances that did recommend and enhance the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, (whether Spiritual or Temporal) as an Encouragement to truſt in God in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Difficulties; and have afterwards found the Comfort and Advantage of being able to have recourſe to ſuch Papers. This Practice I recommend as what hath been uſeful and conſolatory to divers Chriſtians, for many years afterwards; and to ſome others, of their more intimate Friends, to whom they might without vanity be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. What <hi>Experiences</hi> might be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106982:137"/> of ſignal Returns to Prayer, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Manifeſtations of the Truth, and Goodneſs, and Wiſdom of God, if all the <hi>Inſtances</hi> thereof were duly recollected and preſerv'd! And how ſweet and pleaſant would the Work of Prayer and Praiſe then be! With what rejoycing and delight ſhould we ſet about it, and live in it, if the conſtraining Goodneſs and Love of God, and a thankful ſenſe of his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercies, did bring us to him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and animate every word! What Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and Comfort, and probable Hopes (at leaſt) of the ſpecial Love of God, might we derive from the various paſſages of his Compaſſion and Kindneſs! And hereby we may be able more heartily to give him thanks for Pardon, Sanctification, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, which we commonly mention with too much doubt and fear.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be adviſable to examine and record the Workings of <hi>your own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> under ſuch Diſpenſations: what thoughts you then had of God? what Acts of Faith, Love, Thankfulneſs, you did then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt? what Evidences of God's Favour, and what diſcovery of your own Sincerity, you have had at ſuch times? when, and how and by what means you were cur'd of your uncomfortable Unbelief, and rais'd
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106982:138"/> from your Deſpondency? what Promiſes you had recourſe to for relief? what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations were moſt helpful to you? what frame of Spirit you kept up in Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after? what Reſolutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements you made to God, to love, and and truſt, and praiſe, and ſerve him, and give up all to his diſpoſe for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and what conſequent Obligation may be inferr'd from thence, to acquieſce in the Will of God, and reſign our ſelves entirely to Him, ſaying, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever, and He will be our Guide unto Death.</hi>
